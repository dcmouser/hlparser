**Tracking Time**
As each day begins, you will be told what time the day starts and what time the day ends.  Record this information on your Case Log sheet (bottom right).  Start a new Lead Notes sheet for each day, and record every lead that you visit, along with the (starting) time of each visit.
When you read a lead in the story book, you will be told the duration of that lead.  Add this duration to the current time and write this new time on the next blank line; this will be the starting time for the next lead you visit.
. Note: Looking up a lead that is not found in the story book does not cause time to pass.

**Ending your Day**
When each day begins, you will be given a list of items (typically Markers) that **must** be found before you can move on to the next day.  If you find all of these items *before* the designated day end time, you may keep playing until you reach the end time for the current day. Then move on to the day's end-of-shift briefing.

**Overtime**
If the current time passes beyond the designated end time for the day, but you have **not** found all of the day's items, then the next lead you visit will trigger *Overtime*. When this happens, mark the checkbox on your Case Log that indicates that you have entered overtime (OT) for the current day, and mark **5** demerit checkboxes.
Now, for the remainder of the day, you will no longer record the time of lead visits. The clock no longer advances, and you ignore all storybook instructions to do so for the remainder of the day. Note:
. If you encounter lead text that asks what the current time is while you are in overtime, you should consider the current time to be the day's end time.
. If you are in overtime and find all of the required items, your day ends.

**Flextime Mode**
Flextime mode is an optional way to play for those who dislike having to micro-manage the passage of time.
. Ignore all time tracking instructions during the game. Do not record lead times or track the current time. Take as long as you want on each day. You are never in overtime.
. Should you encounter text asking you what time of day it is, simply pick a time of your choice which is: 1) Within the start and end time for day, and 2) Later than any previously chosen time on the same day.
. You may not move on from the current day before you find all of the day's required items; after you find them you may continue the day for as long as you like.
Playing in Flextime mode may reduce the tension you experience but will not otherwise reduce the richness of your experience, and may be more enjoyable for people who would rather focus on the narrative experience without being distracted by record keeping.

**Wrapping-up**
Note that after the last day of your case ends, you will proceed to a conclusion section, but you will have a final opportunity to resume searching for leads without any time limit.
