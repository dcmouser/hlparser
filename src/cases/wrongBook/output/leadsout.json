Record this information on your Case Log sheet (bottom right).  Start a new Lead Notes sheet for each day, and record every lead that you visit, along with the (starting) time of each visit.\nWhen you read a lead in the story book, you will be told the duration of that lead.  Add this duration to the current time and write this new time on the next blank line; this will be the starting time for the next lead you visit.\n. Note: Looking up a lead that is not found in the story book does not cause time to pass.\n~\n**Ending your Day**\nWhen each day begins, you will be given a list of items (typically Markers) that **must** be found before you can move on to the next day.  If you find all of these items *before* the designated day end time, you may keep playing until you reach the end time for the current day. Then move on to the day's end-of-shift briefing.\n~\n**Overtime**\nIf the current time passes beyond the designated end time for the day, but you have **not** found all of the day's items, then the next lead you visit will trigger *Overtime*. When this happens, mark the checkbox on your Case Log that indicates that you have entered overtime (OT) for the current day, and mark **5** demerit checkboxes.\nNow, for the remainder of the day, you will no longer record the time of lead visits. The clock no longer advances, and you ignore all storybook instructions to do so for the remainder of the day. Note:\n. If you encounter lead text that asks what the current time is while you are in overtime, you should consider the current time to be the day's end time.\n. If you are in overtime and find all of the required items, your day ends.\n~\n**Flextime Mode**\nFlextime mode is an optional way to play for those who dislike having to micro-manage the passage of time.\n. Ignore all time tracking instructions during the game. Do not record lead times or track the current time. Take as long as you want on each day. You are never in overtime.\n. Should you encounter text asking you what time of day it is, simply pick a time of your choice which is: 1) Within the start and end time for day, and 2) Later than any previously chosen time on the same day.\n. You may not move on from the current day before you find all of the day's required items; after you find them you may continue the day for as long as you like.\nPlaying in Flextime mode may reduce the tension you experience but will not otherwise reduce the richness of your experience, and may be more enjoyable for people who would rather focus on the narrative experience without being distracted by record keeping.\n~\n**Wrapping-up**\nNote that after the last day of your case ends, you will proceed to a conclusion section, but you will have a final opportunity to resume searching for leads without any time limit.",

Ignore all time tracking instructions during the game. Do not record lead times or track the current time. Take as long as you want on each day. You are never in overtime.\n. Should you encounter text asking you what time of day it is, simply pick a time of your choice which is: 1) Within the start and end time for day, and 2) Later than any previously chosen time on the same day.\n. You may not move on from the current day before you find all of the day's required items; after you find them you may continue the day for as long as you like.\nPlaying in Flextime mode may reduce the tension you experience but will not otherwise reduce the richness of your experience, and may be more enjoyable for people who would rather focus on the narrative experience without being distracted by record keeping.\n~\n**Wrapping-up**\nNote that after the last day of your case ends, you will proceed to a conclusion section, but you will have a final opportunity to resume searching for leads without any time limit.",

These days it\u2019s almost easier to sleep in my chair than in my bed.  I\u2019m just dozing off when I hear a knock at the door.\nThere\u2019s just enough of a pause to give me time to push my hat back and pretend I\u2019m awake.  In walks Jewel with a stack of papers in her hand, trailed by a lady I don\u2019t recognize.  She looks to be in her early 40s.  She\u2019s well put together, with matching black hat and handbag, and shiny black heels.  Looks like she\u2019s from money -- my favorite kind of client.\n\"This is Mrs. Browning,\" says Jewel. \"She wants to hire you to find something or other.\"\nI stand up and stick out my hand. \"Nice to meet you, Mrs. Browning,\" I say, and she puts her white-gloved hand in mine.\n\"I\u2019ll take it from here,\" I say to Jewel, who\u2019s already headed for the door.\n\"If she\u2019s looking for a bird, don\u2019t take the job,\" she says over her shoulder.\n\"You\u2019re not, are you?\" I say to Mrs. Browning.\n\"Not what?\" she asks.\n\"Looking for a lost bird.\"\n\"Who are you, Sam Spade?\"\nA big grin forms on my face, and I sit back down in my chair.  She may be from money, but I like her already.  \"No\", she says, \"I\u2019m looking for a book\".\nShe sits down in the chair opposite my desk and digs into her handbag for a cigarette.  I know how this goes, so I just wait for her to get settled and start talking.\n\"It\u2019s a very rare and valuable book, Mr. Deverell.  One that\u2019s been in my family for generations.  It\u2019s been stolen, and I want you to get it back for me.\"\n\"Sounds like a job for the police,\" I say.\nShe rolls her eyes and leans forward to tap her cigarette in my ashtray.  \"I just came from the police -- they\u2019re the ones who sent me to you.\"\n\"I see.\"  I loosen my tie and pull out the ledger from my desk drawer.  \"Well, my rate is 50 dollars a day plus expenses -- and that\u2019s whether I recover the book or not.\"  What I don\u2019t say is that my normal rate\u2019s 40 dollars a day; the extra 10 is my matching-hat-and-handbag rate.  \"If that suits you, we can get started right away.\"\n\"That will be just fine,\" she says.\n\"OK, start from the beginning, tell me about this book and what you think happened to it.\"\n\"Very well,\" she says, rummaging into her handbag.  \"This is a photo of the book.\"  She hands me a photo of an ornate book, indicating that I can keep it.\n\"It\u2019s an Octavo King James Bible. It was purchased by my great-great-great-grandfather in 1700.\"  She hesitates for a moment, like she\u2019s choosing her words carefully.  \"You must understand, Mr. Deverell, that I come from a deeply religious family -- this book has been smuggled across oceans and deserts, and passed down from generation to generation, from mother to daughter to daughter.  And now it\u2019s been stolen. I must have it back.  It is of incalculable sentimental value.\"\n\"I guess it\u2019s got some non-sentimental value, as well.\"\nShe wrinkles her mouth.  \"It is worth a small fortune.  Though that is of little concern to me.\"\nShe takes a long drag of her cigarette and continues.\n\"I came down from Boston the day before yesterday, to have it appraised -- for insurance purposes, you understand.  I had appointments yesterday with two dealers that had come highly recommended.  The first, a fellow named Wyckoff.  An older gentleman, perhaps 60 years old, tall, white hair, and walks with a limp.  He arrived at my hotel room around 8am.  He studied the book for about 30 minutes, then asked to take the book home with him overnight so he could study it further.  I told him that was out of the question.\nThe second dealer was a Mr. Gorski, who came by around 10am. He was a tiny man, Polish maybe, in his 40s or 50s, with a round balding head and wire-rimmed glasses. He spent a good hour going over the book with a magnifying glass, and said he would get back to me with his assessment.  He also requested that he be permitted to take the book back to his apartment to study it.  I again said no.  That was yesterday.  This morning I went out for breakfast -- I couldn\u2019t have been gone for more than an hour -- and when I returned to the room, the book was gone.\"\n\"So it was taken from your hotel room this morning.  You\u2019re quite sure of that?\"\n\"Quite.\"\n\"And you\u2019ve no doubt talked to the hotel staff already?  Could a maid have walked off with it?\"\nShe taps her cigarette into the ashtray.  \"I\u2019ve talked to the hotel staff.  They claim that the maid was nowhere near the room while I was out.\"\n\"Nothing else disturbed?\" I ask.  \"Nothing else taken?\"\n\"Some jewelry in a nightstand drawer was also taken -- ruby earrings and a matching ruby and silver necklace and bracelet, but they are of no importance to me.  There was cash and traveler\u2019s checks on the entryway table that were untouched.\"\n\"And where is it you\u2019re staying?\" I ask.\n\"The Hotel Cumberland in Times Square.  Room 713.\"\n\"I guess that rules out someone coming in through the window.  Any sign of someone messing with the lock to your door?\"\n\"I\u2019m sure I have no idea.\"\n\"OK, Mrs. Browning, I think that gives me enough to get started.\"  I stand up and show her to the door.  \"I can reach you at the Cumberland?\"\n\"Yes, you can call directly up to room 713 by dialing ",

I\u2019m not sure how Jewel managed to get us tickets at the last minute, but she\u2019s resourceful like that.  As we\u2019re walking up the steps we see mayor Fiorello La Guardia, already inside shaking hands with someone, his pudgy face and rotund body exuding unmistakeable charm.\n![image](images/MuseumNaturalHistory2.jpg|height=6in)\nThe Museum of Natural History is one of my favorite places.  It\u2019s an awe-inspiring place. Dozens of dimly-lit rooms, with giant life-sized dioramas of cavemen and dinosaurs, pottery and tablets from the beginning of civilization, and sparkling gemstones the size of your head.\nJewel seems just as interested as I am, and we leisurely walk to the religious book exhibit, separated by only a few feet of space but a million years of daydreaming.\nThe controversial book exhibit itself is mildly interesting.  I\u2019m half-expecting to see a copy of Mrs. Browning\u2019s book on display, but no dice.  There\u2019s a big section discussing religious books from different cultures, and how each one was treated as blasphemous and sacrilegious by others, despite their common themes.  And there\u2019s a section of shockingly vibrant paintings of Hindu gods that defy description.  I make a note to myself to dig out my oil paints when I get home.\nThere is a section on controversial Christian Bibles, but they seem to be mostly about misprinted editions. The \"Wicked\" Bible, otherwise known as the \"Sinner\u2019s Bible\", was published in 1631 in London, where they accidentally left out the word \"not\" from the sentence \"Thou shalt not commit adultery.\"  Ouch.  Most copies were destroyed, making it highly valuable.  But there\u2019s no hint of any controversy related to Mrs. Browning\u2019s book.\n\"Pretty fascinating stuff, huh, Jewel?\"\nJewel doesn\u2019t hear me; she\u2019s lost in thought.  We wander around a bit more in silence, then part ways and head to our respective homes.\n",

I\u2019ve got a supply of coffee and cigarettes, but I\u2019m hoping this won\u2019t be an all day affair.  The only problem with the place I\u2019ve chosen is I\u2019m getting occasional nasty looks from passers-by.  One big guy across the street looks like he\u2019s fixing to come over and heave me out of my hidey-hole, but then thinks better of it when he sees I\u2019m settled in with my coffee and won\u2019t be easy to dislodge.  I guess it\u2019s true that they don\u2019t take kindly to loitering in Turtle Bay.\nMeanwhile I\u2019m looking for someone that matches Gorski\u2019s description -- short, balding, with wire-rim glasses.  Then I just have to figure out what to do if he shows up to pick up his mail.\nAn hour in, I see someone head to the entrance who looks out of place.  It\u2019s definitely not Gorski.  He\u2019s wearing a tan suit and hat.  Clean shaven.  Tall and skinny, with a pencil moustache.  There\u2019s something odd about the way he\u2019s carrying himself, though -- he\u2019s not walking like he\u2019s heading home, he\u2019s walking like he\u2019s just making a quick stop.\nA couple of minutes after coming in the front door, he\u2019s out again, stuffing envelopes into his jacket pocket.  Bingo.  I don\u2019t know who this guy is, but there can\u2019t be much doubt he\u2019s just gone and collected Gorski\u2019s mail for the week.  I decide to tail him.\nHe heads back down 52nd Street, the way he came.  He\u2019s on the north side of the street, and I\u2019m across the street on the south side, maybe 500 hundred feet behind him -- half a block away.  Not many people on the street this far east, but if he keeps going west I\u2019m going to have to close some ground if I don\u2019t want to lose him.\nSure enough he keeps heading west, across 2nd Avenue, and then right past the 17th Precinct, where he doesn\u2019t skip a beat.  I\u2019m trying to pick up my pace but he\u2019s still a couple hundred feet in front of me, and when he gets to Lexington he crosses the street against the light, then turns left, and I lose sight of him.\nI jog to the corner as inconspicuously as I can in a suit and hat, and look to the left, but I don\u2019t see him.  He can\u2019t have gone far -- but where did he go?\n",

It\u2019s currently a Roman Catholic girls\u2019 school.  At least that\u2019s the idea, though it seems like it\u2019s been closed for repairs or reorganization for the last year or so.\nI notice that while the main front entrance looks like it hasn\u2019t been used in a while, there\u2019s a side entrance that looks like it gets regular use.  The side door is surrounded by large white granite blocks, and looks to be made of steel, with no less than 3 locks on the door.  I know the church is concerned about chastity, but this seems a little excessive.  There\u2019s a small metal plate near the top lock with the initials \"PSC\" stamped on it.\nI listen quietly for any sounds behind the door, but don\u2019t hear anything.  I knock lightly. No answer.  I reach for the doorknob and that\u2019s when I see it: a small smear of blood.  Then I spot another near the edge of the door, and a few more drops on the ground outside.\n%boxstart%\n%Symbol.Choice% *CHOOSE ONE OF THE FOLLOWING:*\n * Force open the door and enter: ",

                    "text": "\nWyckoff\u2019s Rare books  is one of those New York bookstores that feels like it\u2019s out of a movie.  It has a spooky feel, with antique light-bulbs and a maze of 10ft-high floor-to-ceiling bookshelves, all cramped into a footprint that can\u2019t be more than 20ft by 20ft.\nI find the proprietor, an old white-haired gentleman, limping down one of the rows with a large blackened tome in his hand and searching for a place to put it.  It looks heavy, but he doesn\u2019t seem to be having any trouble carrying it.  He finally shelves it next to another large book -- this one red, with what looks like a child\u2019s drawing of a skull on the cover.\n\"You must be Mr. Wyckoff,\" I say.\nHe looks me up and down as if sizing me up.  \"And who are you?\" he says.\n\"I\u2019m Jack Deverell, Mr. Wyckoff.  I\u2019ve been hired by a Mrs. Browning to help locate a lost book.  I\u2019m told you met with her yesterday to appraise it.  An old Bible.\"\n\"*An old Bible!* **Ha!** Is that how she described it?  Heh\u2026 well, I guess it is an old Bible after all.\"\n\"What can you tell me about it?  Was it authentic?  How much was it worth?\"\nHe gives me a long look which might be mistaken for disgust.  \"How much was it worth?  Who are you? You\u2019re not the client.  It\u2019s not your book.  You don\u2019t know anything about it.\"\n\"What about some jewelry of hers, some of ruby earrings, a necklace, and a bracelet? They\u2019re missing from her hotel room -- any chance you walked off with them accidentally?\"\n\"You can fuck right off out of my store.\"\n\"Whoa,\" I say.  \"Take it easy there, we\u2019re working for the same lady.\"\n\"I\u2019m not working for anybody -- she hasn\u2019t paid me yet.  She\u2019ll burn before I see a cent.\"\n\"What does that mean?\"\n\"Fuck off, you don\u2019t know.\"\n\"Mr. Wyckoff, where were you this morning around 8am?\"\n\"Fucking your wife, you vermin.\"\n\"I\u2019m not married.\"\nAt this point he calms himself down, then licks his finger and draws a large round circle in the air in front of my face.  \"Now you can *really* fuck off.\"\nI can see this is going nowhere, so I thank Wyckoff for his hospitality and then leave.\n---\nPlaying a hunch, I cross 3rd Avenue and enter a shop with a window facing Wyckoff\u2019s Rare Books.  Wyckoff himself comes limping out of his bookstore and flips the sign on the door from Open to Closed, then heads south on 3rd Avenue.\nHe\u2019s walking pretty fast for a guy with a limp, but it\u2019s not like I\u2019m going to lose him, so I take my time and let him get half a block away before lighting up a cigarette and starting to follow him.\nHe continues south where 3rd Avenue turns into the Bowery, then turns left on Houston, and then right on Chrystie.  For a minute I panic when I think he\u2019s going to head into the train station on Delancey, and I close my distance.  But he keeps going until he hits the entry to the garden park, then hangs a left and goes down Grand Street.\nThen, something stupid happens.  He gets almost to the corner of Allen Street, and as I\u2019m reaching into my pocket to get another cigarette, the old guy suddenly turns around in a full circle and spots me looking right at him.\nI\u2019m caught off guard, and I hesitate before making a poor pretense at window shopping.  But I can see from the corner of my eye that he\u2019s looking right at me.\nEventually he heads into a real estate office on Allen Street.  Five minutes later he\u2019s headed back uptown the same way he came.\nI convince myself that maybe he didn\u2019t recognize me after all, and waste another 30 minutes following him back up to the bookstore, where he turns the sign from Closed to Open and doesn\u2019t emerge again.\n",

There\u2019s also  a younger guy sitting down next to him staring at the floor.  Late 20s maybe, short brown hair cut in a similar style.  Maybe these guys are cutting each other\u2019s hair.  There must be a back door too, since I hear it closing behind someone leaving.\nI take my time working my way to the back, looking through the worthless junk and occasional military souvenir.  The old man is standing over a cabinet of jewelry.  I take a quick scan -- nothing made of rubies, but a few odd items like a silver necklace with what looks like a razor blade in the center, and a gold bracelet with a pentagram charm.\n\"I\u2019m looking for a ruby bracelet that someone may have brought in recently.\"\n\"I don\u2019t know nothing about it.\" says the old man.\n\"I\u2019d like to see your records,\" I say.\n\"Get lost, you -- I don\u2019t got to show you nothin.  I\u2019m a taxpayer.  I ain\u2019t done nothin wrong.\"\n\"It may be stolen,\" I tell him, \"You don\u2019t want to be selling stolen merchandise, do you?\"\n\"God damn you vermin!  Always harassing me!  Always trying to lock up Cremonesi!  50 years trying to lock me up!  I tell you I ain\u2019t seen them.  Now get out of my store, you scoundrel, before I wallop you over the head and sell your fillings!\"  And with that, he reaches behind him and grabs a broom from some dark shadow.\n\"OK, OK,\" I say.  \"Take it easy.\"  I\u2019m actually kind of surprised the old man knows what a broom looks like.

I told her that the hotel restaurant might be able to make her one at 8am, but she seemed in a hurry so I suggested a deli on 7th Avenue,\"  I\u2019m not sure where she went, but she was back by 8am or 8:30am.\"\n\"And she was alone when she left? And when she came back as well?\"\n\"I believe so.  I don\u2019t remember seeing anyone with her.\"\n\"And no one came by asking for her while she was out?\"\n\"I don\u2019t believe so.\"\n\"Well you were the only one on duty, right? You would know if someone came by looking for her, yeah?\"\n\"Yes, sir - Until 9am I was the only one on duty and couldn\u2019t leave my station unattended; so if anyone came by before then, I would have known about it.\"\n\"Very good.  Can you tell me if Mrs. Browning is in her room now?\" I ask.\n\"I believe she is, sir.\"\n\"And has she had any visitors today?\"\n\"She has not.\"\n\"And no one has called for her?\"\n\"No, sir.\"\nI thank him for his help, and am just turning to leave when a thought seems to occur to him.\n\"Umm\u2026  Actually, you know, now that I think about it\u2026  There was something a little unusual that happened just before 8.  A man in overalls came in and walked right past me to the elevators.  I normally would have stopped him, because he didn\u2019t look like a guest, and it seemed a little early for maintenance work, but he seemed to know where he was going so I didn\u2019t think much of it.\"\n\"Could he have been going to Mrs. Browning\u2019s room?\"\n\"Well, I don\u2019t think so.  He\u2019d be going the long way around if he was.\"\n\"Can you remember what this fellow looked like?\"\n\"Let\u2019s see\u2026  Blue overalls and work boots.  Brown hair, slicked back. Maybe in his 20s?  He may have had glasses\u2026  I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t remember.\"\nI pass him my card.  \"If you think of anything else, give me a ring.\"\n",

Back when I was a cop, I wouldn\u2019t be caught dead working in such a sleepy neighborhood.  The decor looks like they aren\u2019t hurting for money either.\nI look around on the off-chance that I recognize someone, but no such luck, so I tell the officer on duty that I\u2019m a PI and may have some information about yesterday\u2019s murder at the Engineer\u2019s Gate in Central Park.  He directs me to the detectives\u2019 room up the wide polished marble staircase.\nThe detective in charge of the case has his own office, and not a small one.  He\u2019s eating a sandwich with a knife and a fork.  He sees me staring at his plate.\n\"My dentures are acting up,\" he says, pointing to his mouth with his fork, as if that explained it. \"What do you know about my murder?\"\n\"Was he a tall guy, tan suit, pencil-thin moustache?\"\n\"Yeah, what do you know about him?\"\nI decide that he doesn\u2019t need to know about Mrs. Browning and her book, and just tell him that I think it\u2019s likely he was killed by the same guy who cut the throat of the subway attendant at 51st Street.\n\"Did you identify the body?\" I ask.\nDentures pauses with the fork half-way in his mouth and peers up at me.  This guy\u2019s going to make me work for it.\n\"Was it by any chance a Walenty Gorski?\" I ask.\n\"No. Who\u2019s Gorski?\"\nI lean closer and give him my best \"we\u2019re on the same team\" look.  \"Tell you what: I\u2019ll share what I know if you give me the name of the victim.  It\u2019s going to be in the paper by tomorrow anyway.\"\nAfter a bit more back-and-forth he tells me that the dead guy was Constantine Afanasyev, resident of East Village.  He was found face-down outside of Central Park, at the Engineer\u2019s Gate entrance.  He had a large buck knife in his lower back, and was stabbed several times. Was probably dead within minutes.\nThey think he was killed late last night.  He didn\u2019t have Gorski\u2019s mail on him, just a wallet with a few bucks, some change, a driver\u2019s license, and some weird notes that they couldn\u2019t make sense of -- written in a foreign language, they think.  I ask to see the notes and he tells me I\u2019d have a better chance getting a date with Lana Turner.\n\"We\u2019re still waiting on an autopsy from the Chief Medical examiner, but it looks like this guy was dead within minutes of the attack -- didn\u2019t even get a chance to run.\"\n\"Any idea what he was doing uptown?\" I finally ask.\n\"You tell me,\" he says, forking in another square.\n",

                    "text": "\nWyckoff\u2019s Rare books  is one of those New York bookstores that feels like it\u2019s out of a movie.  It has a spooky feel, with antique light-bulbs and a maze of 10ft-high floor-to-ceiling bookshelves, all cramped into a footprint that can\u2019t be more than 20ft by 20ft.\nI find the proprietor, an old white-haired gentleman, limping down one of the rows with a large blackened tome in his hand and searching for a place to put it.  It looks heavy, but he doesn\u2019t seem to be having any trouble carrying it.  He finally shelves it next to another large book -- this one red, with what looks like a child\u2019s drawing of a skull on the cover.\n\"You must be Mr. Wyckoff,\" I say.\nHe looks me up and down as if sizing me up.  \"And who are you?\" he says.\n\"I\u2019m Jack Deverell, Mr. Wyckoff.  I\u2019ve been hired by a Mrs. Browning to help locate a lost book.  I\u2019m told you met with her yesterday to appraise it.  An old Bible.\"\n\"*An old Bible!* **Ha!** Is that how she described it?  Heh\u2026 well, I guess it is an old Bible after all.\"\n\"What can you tell me about it?  Was it authentic?  How much was it worth?\"\nHe gives me a long look which might be mistaken for disgust.  \"How much was it worth?  Who are you? You\u2019re not the client.  It\u2019s not your book.  You don\u2019t know anything about it.\"\n\"What about some jewelry of hers, some of ruby earrings, a necklace, and a bracelet? They\u2019re missing from her hotel room -- any chance you walked off with them accidentally?\"\n\"You can fuck right off out of my store.\"\n\"Whoa,\" I say.  \"Take it easy there, we\u2019re working for the same lady.\"\n\"I\u2019m not working for anybody -- she hasn\u2019t paid me yet.  She\u2019ll burn before I see a cent.\"\n\"What does that mean?\"\n\"Fuck off, you don\u2019t know.\"\n\"Mr. Wyckoff, where were you this morning around 8am?\"\n\"Fucking your wife, you vermin.\"\n\"I\u2019m not married.\"\nAt this point he calms himself down, then licks his finger and draws a large round circle in the air in front of my face.  \"Now you can *really* fuck off.\"\nI can see this is going nowhere, so I thank Wyckoff for his hospitality and then leave.\n---\nPlaying a hunch, I cross 3rd Avenue and enter a shop with a window facing Wyckoff\u2019s Rare Books.  Wyckoff himself comes limping out of his bookstore and flips the sign on the door from Open to Closed, then heads south on 3rd Avenue.\nHe\u2019s walking pretty fast for a guy with a limp, but it\u2019s not like I\u2019m going to lose him, so I take my time and let him get half a block away before lighting up a cigarette and starting to follow him.\nHe continues south where 3rd Avenue turns into the Bowery, then turns left on Houston, and then right on Chrystie.  For a minute I panic when I think he\u2019s going to head into the train station on Delancey, and I close my distance.  But he keeps going until he hits the entry to the garden park, then hangs a left and goes down Grand Street.\nThen, something stupid happens.  He gets almost to the corner of Allen Street, and as I\u2019m reaching into my pocket to get another cigarette, the old guy suddenly turns around in a full circle and spots me looking right at him.\nI\u2019m caught off guard, and I hesitate before making a poor pretense at window shopping.  But I can see from the corner of my eye that he\u2019s looking right at me.\nEventually he heads into a real estate office on Allen Street.  Five minutes later he\u2019s headed back uptown the same way he came.\nI convince myself that maybe he didn\u2019t recognize me after all, and waste another 30 minutes following him back up to the bookstore, where he turns the sign from Closed to Open and doesn\u2019t emerge again.\n",

By the way, how\u2019s the restaurant here?\"\n\"Best in the city.\" she says mechanically, with zero enthusiasm.\n%boxstartred%\n%Symbol.Mark%You have now gained the marker [**H = hotelstaff**]; please circle this letter in your case log (if it's not already circled).\n%boxend%\n---\n\n**DEBUG:** This lead \"suggests\" #[8-6264: Lehigh Safe & Lock Company](#8-6264+p)\n\n**DEBUG:** This lead \"suggests\" #[1-2791: Phoenix Safe Company](#1-2791+p)\n",

The decor looks like they aren\u2019t hurting for money either.\nI look around on the off-chance that I recognize someone, but no such luck, so I tell the officer on duty that I\u2019m a PI and may have some information about yesterday\u2019s murder at the Engineer\u2019s Gate in Central Park.  He directs me to the detectives\u2019 room up the wide polished marble staircase.\nThe detective in charge of the case has his own office, and not a small one.  He\u2019s eating a sandwich with a knife and a fork.  He sees me staring at his plate.\n\"My dentures are acting up,\" he says, pointing to his mouth with his fork, as if that explained it. \"What do you know about my murder?\"\n\"Was he a tall guy, tan suit, pencil-thin moustache?\"\n\"Yeah, what do you know about him?\"\nI decide that he doesn\u2019t need to know about Mrs. Browning and her book, and just tell him that I think it\u2019s likely he was killed by the same guy who cut the throat of the subway attendant at 51st Street.\n\"Did you identify the body?\" I ask.\nDentures pauses with the fork half-way in his mouth and peers up at me.  This guy\u2019s going to make me work for it.\n\"Was it by any chance a Walenty Gorski?\" I ask.\n\"No. Who\u2019s Gorski?\"\nI lean closer and give him my best \"we\u2019re on the same team\" look.  \"Tell you what: I\u2019ll share what I know if you give me the name of the victim.  It\u2019s going to be in the paper by tomorrow anyway.\"\nAfter a bit more back-and-forth he tells me that the dead guy was Constantine Afanasyev, resident of East Village.  He was found face-down outside of Central Park, at the Engineer\u2019s Gate entrance.  He had a large buck knife in his lower back, and was stabbed several times. Was probably dead within minutes.\nThey think he was killed late last night.  He didn\u2019t have Gorski\u2019s mail on him, just a wallet with a few bucks, some change, a driver\u2019s license, and some weird notes that they couldn\u2019t make sense of -- written in a foreign language, they think.  I ask to see the notes and he tells me I\u2019d have a better chance getting a date with Lana Turner.\n\"We\u2019re still waiting on an autopsy from the Chief Medical examiner, but it looks like this guy was dead within minutes of the attack -- didn\u2019t even get a chance to run.\"\n\"Any idea what he was doing uptown?\" I finally ask.\n\"You tell me,\" he says, forking in another square.\n",

Then there\u2019s the issue of the stolen jewelry.  It\u2019s hard to know if it\u2019s central to your case or not, but you should definitely chase down the details and try to put a bow on that -- at least figure out who\u2019s involved even if hard proof and recovering the jewels is outside the scope of your work.

Nothing fancy about the bar, but it does offer me a discreet view of the lobby from where I\u2019m seated.\nThere\u2019s a girl to my left who looks like she might have been a dancer in another life.  She\u2019s too tan to be a New York native, so I ask her what she\u2019s doing in the city.  She tells me she\u2019s traveling with her husband, and just like that, a man I recognize pulls up alongside her.\n\"Come on, Jenny, we\u2019ll be late,\" he says.\n\"OK, Bill, I\u2019m coming,\" she says.\nIt\u2019s Bud Abbott.  He looks shorter in real life.  I look around for Lou but he\u2019s nowhere to be seen.  I try to hear what they\u2019re saying as they move off, but all I pick up is something about Coney Island.\nThe rest of the evening is uneventful, and at around 12:45 am I call it a night and pay my tab.  As I\u2019m heading out, I almost get knocked over by someone hurrying the other way -- big hulking guy with light-brown skin and a big bushy beard. \n%boxstartred%\n%Symbol.Checkbox%Mark **1** culture checkbox in your case log.\n%boxend%\n%boxstartred% Now return to [Day 2 Late Night Leads](#Day_2_Late_Night_Leads+p). %boxend%\n",

The charging documents describe how Mr. Bahandari attacked Mr. Afanasyev outside of Central Park after following him from his place of work, the Convent of the Sacred Heart.  Early reporting suggests that Mr. Bahandari was operating at the behest of Mrs. Browning, whose background and occupation remain unconfirmed.\n%Separator.Final%\n## NEW YORK TIMES - Wednesday, March 12th, 1948*\nNew developments emerged today in the case of last week\u2019s Central Park stabbing of Constantine Afanasyev.

Reliable sources have told the Times that the two are well known in Salem, and are rumored to be members of an underground religious organization long banned in the state of Massachusetts.

District Attorney Frank Hogan laid out the facts of the case:  In early March of this year, Mrs. Browning arrived in the Cumberland Hotel in Manhattan, carrying with her an occult book she intended to have appraised and then sold.  To a shocked courtroom, he described the book as a rare and sacrilegious text: a corrupted variant of the Octavo King James Bible, produced in 1600 by an underground group of dissident monks, with a dozen or more additional hand-illustrated pages of pornographic, satanic, and occult imagery. The one-of-a-kind Bible was purchased by Mrs. Browning\u2019s ancestor, and had only ever been rumored among occultists to exist.\nMr. Hogan described the chain of events as follows: Mrs. Browning used her contacts in the occult underworld to locate two potential dealers for an appraisal of the Bible.  One of these, a Mr. Wyckoff, allegedly robbed Mrs. Browning of valuable jewelry while briefly left alone with the book in her hotel room.  The jewelry was recovered from the pawnshop of a Mr. Cremonesi, who has since pleaded guilty to receipt of stolen goods.\n > *As I read this I think back over my interactions with Wyckoff and Cremonesi, how the two of them used some of the same odd vernacular, and how Cremonesi had slipped up when denying he had seen the stolen jewelry.  Not to mention how Wyckoff had been steps away from the pawn shop before he spotted me and turned back.*\nThe other dealer, going by the name Walenty Gorski, was in truth an agent for an underground Catholic organization whose stated purpose is to remove sacrilegious texts from distribution.  It appears this organization, operating locally out of the Convent of the Sacred Heart, had become aware of the book\u2019s existence and sought to steal it.\nThe organization used the Phoenix Safe Company, owned by a sympathetically aligned religious family, to burgle the hotel room of Mrs. Browning and steal the book.  Father and son, both trained locksmiths, allegedly worked together -- one monitoring the whereabouts of Mrs. Browning while she left her hotel room for breakfast, and the other picking the lock of her hotel room door in order to obtain the book.  Witnesses at the Cumberland Hotel and the Carnegie Deli were able to positively identify both men.  It is unclear whether the ultimate aim was to acquire the book in order to dispose of it, or simply to remove it from circulation.\nWhen Mrs. Browning discovered that the book had been stolen, she hired a private investigator to track it down, but directed her accomplice Mr. Bahandari (who had secretly checked into a separate room of the hotel) to conduct a parallel investigation, and to recover the book by any means necessary.  \n%Separator.Final%\n## NEW YORK TIMES - Tuesday, May 4th, 1948*\nThe prosecution today continued their case against Clarice Browning and Choka Bahandari,  describing how Mr. Bahandari had managed to locate an employee of the  Sacred Heart Convent, Constantine Afanasyev.  Mr. Afanasyev had been hired to pick up mail from the Gorski residence, which was used by the organization as a kind of front from which they could safely conduct their clandestine operations.  Afanasyev was apparently followed to the Convent of the Sacred Heart, and murdered nearby.\nIn a shocking disclosure, the district attorney described a second, previously unreported murder of another Sacred Heart employee, believed to be the book appraiser known to Mrs. Browning as Walenty Gorski.  This man appears to have been tortured in an attempt to force him to reveal the location of the stolen book.\nThe prosecution has not yet identified the dead man, but they have confirmed that the real Gorski died several years ago.  It now appears that the Sacred Heart offices, along with the apartment where Gorski\u2019s mail was delivered, were being used as a front for their clandestine operation; fake identities were also used to protect their members.  The motive behind these actions remains unclear, as does the method by which they made contact with Mrs. Browning.  District Attorney Frank Hogan has hinted that charges may be forthcoming at a further date.\nThere seems to be no dispute that the satanic book had been hidden all along in a floor safe at the Phoenix Safe Company; however, a warrant executed last month failed to recover the book, and its current whereabouts are unknown.\n > *I realize as I read this paragraph in the paper that the mysterious note we received on wednesday mentions the word \"safe\" an inordinate number of times\u2026  I guess the guy was hoping I would protect the book if anything happened to him. Either that or the guy had a screw loose and didn\u2019t even realize what he was saying.*\nPolice believe that the Sacred Heart is part of a larger organization, possibly run by the reclusive and politically-connected Reverend Carlo Lori, who appears to be the registered owner of many of the group\u2019s real estate properties.  Police have declined to elaborate or discuss whether an active investigation is ongoing.\nIt was revealed in court today that this religious organization sent Mrs. Browning a genuine and highly valuable *unadulterated* copy of the Bible in exchange for the stolen book, in an effort to dissuade her from trying to recover the stolen edition.  The whereabouts of the replacement book are currently unknown.\nThe private detective originally hired to locate the stolen book was none other than Jack Deverell, whose storied and controversial career in the NYPD has been the subject of many articles in the Times. Mr. Deverell could not be reached for comment, but a statement released from his office today said simply that he would not discuss any details of the case due to client confidentiality and the general lack of integrity on the part of the New York press core.\n%Separator.Final%\n## NEW YORK TIMES - Monday, May 10th, 1948*\nA shocking end today to the double-murder trial of Clarice Browning and Choka Bahandari.  Both were expected to take the stand today in their own defense, but were found deceased in their separate jail cells, apparently of self-inflicted cyanide poisoning.  As of yet there is no word on how the two could have obtained access to the poison.  Investigations are ongoing.\n\n",

District Attorney Frank Hogan laid out the facts of the case:  In early March of this year, Mrs. Browning arrived in the Cumberland Hotel in Manhattan, carrying with her an occult book she intended to have appraised and then sold.  To a shocked courtroom, he described the book as a rare and sacrilegious text: a corrupted variant of the Octavo King James Bible, produced in 1600 by an underground group of dissident monks, with a dozen or more additional hand-illustrated pages of pornographic, satanic, and occult imagery. The one-of-a-kind Bible was purchased by Mrs. Browning\u2019s ancestor, and had only ever been rumored among occultists to exist.\nMr. Hogan described the chain of events as follows: Mrs. Browning used her contacts in the occult underworld to locate two potential dealers for an appraisal of the Bible.  One of these, a Mr. Wyckoff, allegedly robbed Mrs. Browning of valuable jewelry while briefly left alone with the book in her hotel room.  The jewelry was recovered from the pawnshop of a Mr. Cremonesi, who has since pleaded guilty to receipt of stolen goods.\n > *As I read this I think back over my interactions with Wyckoff and Cremonesi, how the two of them used some of the same odd vernacular, and how Cremonesi had slipped up when denying he had seen the stolen jewelry.  Not to mention how Wyckoff had been steps away from the pawn shop before he spotted me and turned back.*\nThe other dealer, going by the name Walenty Gorski, was in truth an agent for an underground Catholic organization whose stated purpose is to remove sacrilegious texts from distribution.  It appears this organization, operating locally out of the Convent of the Sacred Heart, had become aware of the book\u2019s existence and sought to steal it.\nThe organization used the Phoenix Safe Company, owned by a sympathetically aligned religious family, to burgle the hotel room of Mrs. Browning and steal the book.  Father and son, both trained locksmiths, allegedly worked together -- one monitoring the whereabouts of Mrs. Browning while she left her hotel room for breakfast, and the other picking the lock of her hotel room door in order to obtain the book.  Witnesses at the Cumberland Hotel and the Carnegie Deli were able to positively identify both men.  It is unclear whether the ultimate aim was to acquire the book in order to dispose of it, or simply to remove it from circulation.\nWhen Mrs. Browning discovered that the book had been stolen, she hired a private investigator to track it down, but directed her accomplice Mr. Bahandari (who had secretly checked into a separate room of the hotel) to conduct a parallel investigation, and to recover the book by any means necessary.  \n%Separator.Final%\n## NEW YORK TIMES - Tuesday, May 4th, 1948*\nThe prosecution today continued their case against Clarice Browning and Choka Bahandari,  describing how Mr. Bahandari had managed to locate an employee of the  Sacred Heart Convent, Constantine Afanasyev.  Mr. Afanasyev had been hired to pick up mail from the Gorski residence, which was used by the organization as a kind of front from which they could safely conduct their clandestine operations.  Afanasyev was apparently followed to the Convent of the Sacred Heart, and murdered nearby.\nIn a shocking disclosure, the district attorney described a second, previously unreported murder of another Sacred Heart employee, believed to be the book appraiser known to Mrs. Browning as Walenty Gorski.  This man appears to have been tortured in an attempt to force him to reveal the location of the stolen book.\nThe prosecution has not yet identified the dead man, but they have confirmed that the real Gorski died several years ago.  It now appears that the Sacred Heart offices, along with the apartment where Gorski\u2019s mail was delivered, were being used as a front for their clandestine operation; fake identities were also used to protect their members.  The motive behind these actions remains unclear, as does the method by which they made contact with Mrs. Browning.  District Attorney Frank Hogan has hinted that charges may be forthcoming at a further date.\nThere seems to be no dispute that the satanic book had been hidden all along in a floor safe at the Phoenix Safe Company; however, a warrant executed last month failed to recover the book, and its current whereabouts are unknown.\n > *I realize as I read this paragraph in the paper that the mysterious note we received on wednesday mentions the word \"safe\" an inordinate number of times\u2026  I guess the guy was hoping I would protect the book if anything happened to him.

Police have declined to elaborate or discuss whether an active investigation is ongoing.\nIt was revealed in court today that this religious organization sent Mrs. Browning a genuine and highly valuable *unadulterated* copy of the Bible in exchange for the stolen book, in an effort to dissuade her from trying to recover the stolen edition.  The whereabouts of the replacement book are currently unknown.\nThe private detective originally hired to locate the stolen book was none other than Jack Deverell, whose storied and controversial career in the NYPD has been the subject of many articles in the Times.

                "text": "I hope you have enjoyed this case.  I tried to make this one a little tricky with a variety of obstacles that you would have to figure out to follow up on leads.\nOne of the elements of the case that was most tricky was the way you were supposed to figure out that Wyckoff stole the jewelry.  Here is what I tried to do:\nWhen you tail Wyckoff from his shop, he spots you at the end.  He made it to just right across the street from a pawn shop, which is meant to connect him to it.  The especially tricky part, however, is that he is right at the boundary of neighborhoods, and the pawn shop is in the next neighborhood over (Lower East Side).\nYou may in fact discover that pawn shop, as one player did, while investigating the dead body of Constantine, which may lead you to wrongly think he was the one who stole the jewelry.\nThere are, however, two more clues to connect Wyckoff to the pawn shop.  First, Wyckoff and Cremonesi, the pawn shop owner, have a similar disposition, and both use the words \"vermin\" -- I suspect they are good friends.  More damning, however, is that when we question the pawn shop owner, we mention \"a stolen bracelet\", when in fact it was several items that were stolen. He says \"I haven\u2019t seen **them**.\"  A little slip-up on his part that tells you he\u2019s our man.\nAs a side note, early playtesters suffered trying to find the pawnshop because I accidentally put two more pawn shops on the same block as where Wyckoff turned around, and in the neighborhood where he was walking. Ouch.\nAnother subtle element is in the third note you get.  If you study it you will note that the word \"safe\" is used many times -- that\u2019s meant to clue you in that he\u2019s stashed it at the Phoenix Safe Company in the floor safe that is mentioned.  The old man and the kid with long brown hair that work there are the same people who were watching and breaking into Mrs. Browning\u2019s hotel room on day 2.  The old man follows her to Carnegie Deli while the kid gets into her hotel room.  You\u2019ll note that the PSC log on the Sacred Heart Convent is from their locksmith shop.\nI had some spirited debates with playtesters about whether the clues to Phoenix Safe company were strong enough or too subtle.  In response I made some later changes to make it both a little bit easier to connect the Deli witness to the Phoenix guy, but also added a question that asked the players how they would prove it if they had to -- my hope is that that question will spur some debate (the answer is that you could try to get the deli and hotel people to id the phoenix father and son).\nOne more subtle element is tracking down the name of the killer, who works for Mrs. Browning.  To do so you\u2019ll have to visit the taxi company serving the neighborhood where the murder took place.  The taxi company gives you the name of the driver and tells you to come back tomorrow when she gets in\u2026 but your case doesn\u2019t last 4 days, so you\u2019ll have to visit her yourself.  She\u2019ll tell you his nationality and his first name.  With that you could go to the Indian Consulate and find out his full name.  And with that you can revisit the hotel to get his room number.  Note that this was meant to be a non-essential part of the mystery that only advanced players would be able to find.  I have to admit that a trip to the Indian Consulate is not the first thing that I would have thought to do.  So many consulates, so little time.\nThe last bit of bonus mystery for advanced players relates to the real identity of the man known as Gorski and the larger organization behind him.  If you visit the Property & tax records office (6-5810): NYC Department of Finance (see Research Guide), you will learn the name of Reverend Carlo Lori, whom you can visit to confirm that he is the man behind the operation (and the man pretending to be Gorski).\nI should note that there is a fair amount of disagreement on the part of early playtesters regarding the difficulty of the case and whether there is sufficient evidence for players to answer the questions about who took the book.  To me it feels like it\u2019s a hard case but that there are enough clues to make an educated guess.  What do you think?\nI hope you enjoyed the moral and other choices you faced.  Which choices did you make, and why?  There are no right or wrong answers.  You might be wondering about the instructions to record things in your \"Campaign Log\".  This case occurs somewhere in the middle of a long campaign planned for High & Low, with legacy elements where your decisions in one case may carry over to another.  Whether that campaign gets finished remains to be seen.\nOne of the mechanical aspects of the case that underwent lots of debate was the use of the markers to \"gate\" your progress between days, to make sure you had seen certain things each day.  The basic idea of doing this has always been a key part to High & Low, to help make the multi-day structure work.  Essentially this process ensures that players have seen critical leads so they have a reasonable chance of solving the case at the end, and that they don\u2019t miss a critical lead that will make the experience unpleasant.  This was originally implemented in this case by having the player answer end-of-day questions that asked about certain things and sent them back into the field if they hadn\u2019t found them.  Afterwards I had the idea of using the conditional markers (e.g. \"mark letter A\"), which are already used to check certain conditions, as checks between days.  This works mechanically, and we added a kind of time deadline to add some tension and reward efficient players -- though I hope it will not serve to discourage players from investigating everything.  An in-game hint system was added to help players that feel stuck and don\u2019t know what to do.\nI\u2019d love to hear what you thought of the case and any bugs you found. You can contact me at jessereichler@gmail.com or stop by the Co-op For Two YouTube Channel or Discord server (link on YouTube \"About\" page).\nIf you\u2019re interested in making your own case for the High & Low system, stop by boardgamegeek.com and reach out to me -- the materials are all available and I\u2019d love to see more cases made.\nSpecial thanks to Debbie Levy for editing, and to early beta testers Dispaminite, Rocky Helton (who made his own case!), Jonathan Warner, Nicola Salmoria, and all the others in the High & Low Discord roundtable for talking through ideas.\n-Jesse Reichler, February 20, 2024\n\n",
