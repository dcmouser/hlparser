# Introduction (section=D1)
It’s 6pm on Friday evening and I’m standing with Harry Stone in the Gallery of Living Art across from Washington Square park, where they’ve just opened the doors on an exhibition of paintings by local police officers, and people are starting to trickle in.  Harry’s my new deputy sergeant, and we’ve only been partnered for a couple of weeks, but I don’t think he’s ever stepped foot in an art gallery before. He’s smart enough to know that he’s supposed to like my work.
“It looks just like him”, he says.
I wince.  It’s a painting of the old man who owned the shoe store outside of the 6th precinct where we work. His face looks as thin as a vagabond’s, lined and crumpled like a discarded tobacco wrapper. That much I got right.  But his eyes haunt me. How do you capture the spirit of a guy who came to America without a penny to his name, managed to survive a financial crisis that wiped out half the city, and then was beaten to death by some maniac who was having a bad day. I can barely look at it without feeling sick.
“Lieutenant Malcolm Lockwood?” someone whispers behind me, catching me off guard.
It’s too late to pretend I wasn’t spooked, so I just flip my fedora back on my head and turn casually.  It’s Archie Babin, a beat cop I know from my patrolman days.  A friend. Well, sort of.
“Long time no see, Archie.”  He looks embarrassed to be caught in a place like this.  He’s the size of a large bear and he sticks out among the starving artists.
His hat’s already in his hand, and I can see right away this is personal.  “I need favour, Malcolm.”  Right to the point. He’s not messing around.
“It’s my little brother, sir.  He’s mixed up in something, and he won’t talk to me.”
“What do you expect me to do about it, Archie?”
“I need you to talk to him, sir, find out what‘s going on.  Talk some sense into him.”
I want to ask Archie how that’s supposed to work, but what’s the point.  I look over at Harry to see what he thinks, and he’s already got his notepad out.  Good kid. “Ok, Archie, what’s his name and where can I find him?”
“Sam. Sam Babin.  He’s my little brother.  He’s a PI up in Bloomingdale.  As for where you can find him, he’s a Jazz nut. Spends most of his days in a joint called the Cosy Cat or Cozy Cave, or, something like that, up on Broadway.”
Harry gives me a look and shrugs.  I give Archie a reassuring pat on the back. “Ok, Archie, we’ll see what we can do.”  Anything to get me out of here.

# 1-1432: Glynn’s phone number
We call, but no one answers at Glynn’s home number. 

# 1-3018: 10 Downing Street Apartments – doorman
It turns out that Harry knows the doorman at 10 Downing Street Apartments.
“Hiya Danny! How’s life treating you?” Harry booms, while grabbing Danny’s hand and pumping wildly. The Sergeant’s smile is warm enough to heat coffee. “Let me introduce my new lieutenant – Malcolm Lockwood.”  Then he turns to me: “Lieutenant, Danny here’s kind of like a knight in shining armour. He takes care of his flock so the wolves don’t get ‘em.” I almost want to explain to Harry the concept of a mixed metaphor, but we don’t have the time.
Danny looks like he might have been a dapper chap once – before his love affair with German beer and Italian pasta. We give him a description of Sam Babin and ask if he’s seen him.
“Ya, I know that guy,” Danny replies in a thick Russian accent. “Started showing up a month ago. Always he asks to see Miss Ayala. She never lets him up to her place. Instead, she comes here to the lobby where I can keep watch. And always she takes her two friends along with her – Miss Blaak and Miss Uvarova. Since a month ago, they talk with him maybe once a week. The first time he came here, I saw Miss Ayala give him a picture of someone, but I could not see face. And Miss Ayala is always giving him a little folded piece of paper when they meet.  Maybe a bank check or a note or something like that. I don’t know if that’s important.  Do you think it could be?”
“Could be” I say, nodding. “You don’t happen to know if she uses a bank around here, do you, Danny?”
He thinks for a second.“There’s a bank on Broadway”, says Danny, “but I think Mrs. Ayala uses the one downtown, on Broom street.”
“Oh and one more thing officer,” Danny lifts his huge hand and points across the street. “Sometimes, they go to Dante’s to talk. They just went over a little while ago.”
“You saw them tonight?” I give Harry a quick glance.
“Yes sir. All three walked over to Dante’s around 7pm. I assume they are still there.” Looks like we caught a break.
“Keep up the good work, Danny,” Harry says, shaking his hand.
As Danny walks us out the front door an old lady across Downing street is leaning outside of her balcony trying to get his attention.  “Danny, I told you those harlots are up to no good! They’re going to get you locked up one of these days.  Stay away from harlots!”
“She’s always looking out for me,” he says, waving her off with a smile.

# 1-3397: Glynn’s PI
“Glynn’s,” Harry snorts with derision. “What kind of name is that for a Private Investigator? I mean, Glynn’s could be anything. A car dealership. A butcher.” 
“What name would you pick?”
“Something with panache like… Ragged Angel.” He spreads his hands out as he imagines it in front of him.
I note the dreamy tone. “Well, remember me when you set up shop.”
We head into Glynn’s office building, and through the elegant Georgian lobby. Glynn himself is lean, fit and regal. He looks more like an English lord than a Yank PI.
Sure enough, he speaks with an Oxford accent. “I was wondering when the local constabulary would grace my abode” he says.
“We’re sorry for your loss” I say.  Something about my voice irks him.
“You’re not from the Bloomingdale precinct. What’s your stake in Sam’s death?”
“My sergeant and I were there when Sam Babin was killed. That makes it my business now.”
He rubs his chin and Harry pops his knuckles. “Tell me this,” I ask. “What was Sam working on lately?”
“I really can’t say.”
“You can’t say, or you won’t say?” I ask.
Mr. Glynn pulls a gold zippo lighter from his pocket and starts flipping the lid open and closed while he thinks about what he wants to say.. Click-clack… Click-clack.
“Sam and I don’t share cases, we just share an office.  But he was my partner and he didn’t deserve to go out like that.I don’t know what Sam was working on.
“Well what would $40 a week buy someone?”
He pauses.  Click-clack.  “Well, $40 is what we normally charge for a missing person job.  Missing persons and death threats.”
“Death threats?” Harry asks.
“You know, you tick someone off; you receive an anonymous death threat.  For $40 we figure out who’s threatening you.”
“But stopping the threats, that’s extra, yeah?” ask Harry.  A wide grin forms on Glynn’s face.
I nod and point my fedora at the expensive bottle of whiskey on his desk. “We’ll leave you to your grief.” 
# 1-3406: Otto’s Shrunken Head
The streets get shadier and meaner the deeper we drive into the infamous Gashouse District.
“Through me you pass into the city of woe. All hope abandon ye who enter here,” I mutter.
“What’s that, sir?” Harry asks.
“Just something from Dante.” I say.
We park close to Otto’s Shrunken Head, and no sooner has Harry pulled the handbrake than an old man leans down by his window, “Coppers. I can smell you’re coppers – and so can everyone else here. You don’t want to hang around here, for the sake of your health.” His breath is a health hazard.
 “We’re not here to bother anyone, mister. We’re just looking for a description of the gals who work here” I say, pointing to the Shrunken Head.
“What’s it to you?” the old man growls, treating me to another whiff of his breath.
“We’re just looking for a friend,” I say.  “Tell you what, you ask around a little bit, and we’ll come back tomorrow and make it worth your while. That alright with you?”
“Ah.. Maybe it is. I’ll be here.”
 
 

# EffyReinterview: Re-interviewing Effy (autoid=true)
Harry is in a foul mood when we head up to Efimiya Uvarova’s apartment. I don’t think he likes being lied to by a dame.
She meets us like a diplomat expecting an international incident.
“Gentlemen, come on in.” For a second, she bars the way into her sitting room as if challenging me to shoulder past, but I wait. She smiles even wider before taking a short step back, and I smell her perfume on the way in.  
Uvarova’s apartment is modest, but neat and ordered – like her outfit. She’s got coffee ready; seems like she was expecting us.  Or someone else.  She passes a cup to Harry and one to me. The gesture doesn’t melt the ice in Harry’s eyes. There’s a tiny kitchenette in an alcove off the sitting room, just like my apartment – and like mine, her heating doesn’t seem to work so well.
Harry takes the lead, like we’d planned. “You lied to us at Dante’s. Your real name is Efimiya Uvarova. You know Denice Ayala. All that stuff about you looking for stories and her just being some floozie Sam Babin fancied was pure bunk. Denice walked into Dante’s with you and your friend, but when we showed up, she was gone. Where did she go?” 
Uvarova raises her coffee cup to her lips. Harry refuses to drink his, but I’m mine’s already half gone.
“I hear,” she responds, “that Mr Babin was shot. It was on the radio. That’s a pity…”
“Stop,” Harry says in a low voice. “Tell us the truth before something bad happens to someone else. Why were you and Denice meeting with Sam? Where is Denice now?”
“If I didn’t know any better, I would call that a bad case of foreshadowing. You know what that is?”
“Yeah, it means you know something.”
Uvarova laughs and it’s… well it’s not an unpleasant sound.
Harry grinds his teeth then opens his mouth, but she heads him off and looks at me. “Lt. Lockwood, I will speak with you alone.  Your friend can wait in the lobby.”  
It’s Harry’s turn to laugh his booming laugh, but I say nothing and lock eyes with him until he gets it. His face falls, but then he frowns and… I can’t figure out what he’s thinking, but he looks at Uvarova and back at me. An honest smile twists his lips, and he exits the room.
Uvarova seats herself on a plush armchair. She’s wearing a red dressing gown that covers her from neck to ankle. She offers me a cigarette, which I decline.
“You look like a gin and tonic man,” she says.
“I don’t drink”
She frowns. “Very well then, I will barter information, Lieutenant.”
“What’s your price, Miss Uvarova?”
She holds up three fingers. “First – call – me – Effy. Second, I want to know your first name. And third, I want you to tell me something about yourself – something I could use in a story.”
“Alright, Effy.” I’m talking before I know it. “My first name is Malcolm. And I’m a bit of a painter in my spare time. Will that suffice?”
She purses her lips and lifts her hands, palms-up, imitating scales. Her hands bob up and down, up and down. “Hmm, I suppose.  She puts out her cigarette in an ashtray.   Call Martinez-Plough’s Gallery. Speak to Violet Tomlin. She’s one of several secretaries for the owner of the gallery. Tell her you’re a detective. She thinks you’re the most romantic creatures alive. Ask her about Denice. Obviously, don’t call right now. Wait until tomorrow. It’s laughably late. Speaking of which, I need my beauty sleep. Girl’s gotta work tomorrow.”
Suddenly feeling as out of place as a clown at a hair salon, I make my departure.
Harry is waiting for me in the lobby downstairs. “Well, sir?”
“Well,” I say, putting my hat back on my head, “we have a lead for tomorrow.”

# 2-4867: Sam Babin phone 
We dial the telephone number listed for Sam Babin, but no one picks up.

# 2-7393: Morgan Guaranty Trust Company
A call to the Morgan Guaranty Trust confirms that Denice Ayala is not a client; neither is Sam Babin or anyone else involved in the case.
# 5-1658: Hanover Bank
I burn a few more favors to get the manager of Hanover to meet me in front of their building, despite the late hour. He’s sour about it, but he scurries inside to fetch their files on Denice Ayala.
Not much activity, he says, in a high nasal voice.  “Except that for the last three weeks she’s written a $40 check to Glynn’s Private Investigating Firm”
# 3-2470: Cosy Cadence
It’s 6.30pm, and Detective Sergeant Harry Stone and I make our way to the entrance of the Cosy Cadence jazz club. Physically, the two of us make a wicked study in contrasts.I’ve got a medium build, green eyes, and a chin sharp enough to open envelopes. Harry is a beanpole, almost seven feet tall, but spare in the muscle department. I’d wager good money he can run ten miles and still have enough wind in his lungs to play a tuba. His knuckles tell stories of violent victories – ditto the white scar under his right eye.
Harry keeps a half step behind me. I assume he’s showing deference to my rank. “I’ll bet a week’s wages there’s a stage inside with some siren swaying her lovely hips around the microphone” he says.
I offer no opinion on sirens or other mythological creatures.
He’s not wrong. Archie’s brother – Sam Babin – is perched on a stool close to the stage, ogling the singer in her red dress.
If the angels who crafted Archie’s body took inspiration from a bear, the ones responsible for his brother took their cue from a ferret. He’s handsome, I’ll admit, in a sly, rakish sort of way. Moreover, he’s smart enough to notice us eyeing him, but we flash our badges and take up station by his seat.
“My brother sent you, didn’t he?” Sam Babin sighs. “You here to set me on the straight and narrow?”
“Let’s talk outside,” I say, struggling to make myself heard over the din, “The noise is making my sergeant’s teeth rattle.”
Sam reluctantly walks outside with us, mumbling something about an appointment. “What do you fellas want?”
“You on a case?” I ask.
“What’s it to you, mister?”
Harry chips in, “That’s lieutenant Lockwood to you.  And you can call me sergeant Stone.” I can sense a little anger in his voice -- I guess he doesn’t like being disrespected --  “and unless you want to spend the night in a jail cell you better start answering our questions.”
Sam gets the hint but he’s made it as an idle threat. “Look fellas, it’s not like I don’t appreciate my big brother trying to play guardian angel, but I don’t need his help. Go tell my brother to mind his own business. I’ve got a cab to catch.”
Harry flexes his knuckles and takes a step towards Sam.  He seems to have forgotten why we’re here. I put an arm across his chest. “Wouldn’t be much of a favour to Archie, would it?” I say.
Sam smiles nervously then turns and hurries off down West 94th Street.
I turn towards my car with Harry in tow. He starts to say something when I hear a car backfire behind us. No. Not a backfire! I turn. Sam Babin is down on the pavement. At least, I can see his shoes in a pool of light from the streetlamp. There’s no one standing around him. No one on the opposite side of the street. All the traffic lights are green, and cars are speeding by.
I race towards the shoes, find the man’s wrist and feel for a pulse. Nothing. Blood stains his white shirt.
“Shot,” Harry breathes. He looks around for witnesses. Good man. But there’s no one.
I quickly rummage through Sam’s coat, and the inside pocket yields a note.
Half an hour later, we’ve established that no one in the club saw or heard anything.
“No shell casing anywhere,” Harry observes.
“So, either a revolver or a pistol fired from inside a car; most likely a revolver.” I pass the note to Harry. “Our destination.”
“What about jurisdiction, sir? This isn’t our beat, and anyway, won’t they want us interviewed?”
I spot a payphone. “No. This case is ours. I’m calling in a favor. We’re going to Dante’s. Go find a patrolman who can secure the scene.”
[INSERT HERE: A HANDWRITTEN NOTE WITH THE WORDS: Meet at 8 in Dante’s; Damn Effy and Claire will be there too – as always.]
# 3-6517: Colonial Detective Agency
We ask for Freddie Forsythe at the Colonial Detective Agency and share the news regarding Sam Babin.
“In this particular case, I shan’t mind speaking ill of the dead,” he responds in a distinctly Australian accent. “Sammy was a colleague of mine for a stint.”
“Did he leave of his own volition?” I ask, sensing an opening.
Mr Forsythe spreads his hands. “Well.. Yes and no. We have a code, you see. In the main, PIs can be trusted to investigate and avoid the nasty temptation of using what we discover to blackmail our clients.”
There’s a long pause before he continues.
“To be sure, there was never any definitive **proof** that Sam actually broke the code, but let’s just say I couldn’t keep him on.”

# 3-6861: Hall of Records
The Hall of Records is so quiet we can hear dust motes chafing against each other. The silence is not unwelcome and I can’t help but smile.
“Here we are,” Harry announces. “Looks like Denice Ayala has a younger sister named Alice. She was in foster care in the Gashouse District, but the system lost track of her five years ago. That would make Alice… sixteen years old now.”
“Last known address?” I ask.
“Nothing, sir. It only says that both Ayala daughters were orphans. There’s real shoddy record-keeping for orphans from the Gashouse District. No listed parents or guardians, just a note that the sisters were separated during foster care, and that’s it.”
I glare at the walls of the building. “You’re not being our best friend today.”
“There’s something else, sir. Looks like Efimiya Uvarova and Claartje Blaak are Gashouse orphans too. In fact, they spent time in the same orphanage before Denice and Alice were placed in foster care.”
“Address for the orphanage?”
“The building was knocked down and rebuilt as a waterfront warehouse five years ago.”
“Hmmm..” I say, thinking. “So Uvarova and Blaak have done well for themselves. Any employment records for Denice Ayala?”
“Yes, sir. It says here she worked as a secretary at Aliyev’s Art Gallery in the East Village until ‘36 and then got a job as a secretary at Martinez-Plough's Gallery in Bloomingdale.”
“I know them both,” I say without thinking.
“You know about art, sir?”
“Yes” I say laconically, trying to will him into remembering the start of our evening looking at the Living Art gallery.
“I wonder if anyone at Aliyev’s will answer the horn at this time of night” he says, oblivious.
 
# 4-2174: Downing Street Apartment 4a
We head up to Denice Ayala’s apartment, ignoring Danny the doorman’s protests, but all we get for our trouble is scraped knuckles from banging on the door. I decide against pushing my luck by trying to coax Danny into giving us access without a warrant.

# 4-3488: Aliyev’s Art Gallery
By the time I’m given the personal home number of the head curator of Aliyev’s Art Gallery, I’ve probably earned new enemies. However, Miss Aliyev’s tone softens when I ask after Denice Ayala.
“Brilliant mind, that woman,” she exclaims. “Meticulous. Ordered. Determined. You’d never know she grew up so poor. Then again, people with that sort of background often have something to prove, and Denice has certainly proved herself. I met her in some hotel, I forgot which one, but she was working as a receptionist, and I took her under my wing. Saw her potential instantly, and boy was I vindicated! When she was ready, I landed her that job as secretary at Martinez-Plough's Gallery. She is a real treasure – and I hear she’s doing quite well for herself financially. Standing on her own two feet!! Hmmm… Are you calling to offer her a better position elsewhere?”
“Thank you for your cooperation” I say.

# 4-9259: Violet Tomlin phone number
We call Violet Tomlin’s number, but no one’s picking up the horn.
“It’s late,” I observe. “Better try her tomorrow, like Miss Uvarova suggested.”

# 5-1662: Martinez-Plough's Gallery
No one is available at the Martinez-Plough's Gallery.

# 5-2757: Rainbow Taxi Service
Several of the boys at the Rainbow Taxi Service are old pals of Harry’s.
“This man right here,” he announces, pointing at me, “is my new boss. Meet Lt. Lockwood. Now you bunch answer his questions and make me look good, alright?”
Harry’s friends offer me cigarettes and beer, but I decline as politely as possible, and run through our persons of interest. No one recognises any of them.
“Except!” one wiry man, barely old enough to drink the beer he’s holding, pipes up. “I think I picked up your Miss Uvarova up from her apartment building and took her to Martinez-Plough's Gallery. That must have been… around 7pm yesterday.”
“Thank you for your cooperation.”
“You don’t smoke, sir?” Harry asks as we leave.
“No Sergeant, and before you ask, I don’t drink alcohol either.”
The air between us drops a few degrees. “Some code,” I hear him whisper.

# 5-4170: 15 Downing Street
Mrs Alide Moretti is a widow in her 60s, but that doesn’t stop her from following fashion and keeping her grey hair in the latest style. She’s even wearing a heavily beaded dress like the lady from Dante’s.
“Well now, aren’t you a handsome Joe,” she says, winking at Harry. “What can you do for me?”
“Well, I, um...” says Harry.
“Silly me – I suppose the question is, what can I do for you?”
I take pity on the poor guy and step in. “Mrs. Moretti, have you noticed any unusual activity across the way in the Downing Street Apartments -- maybe involving three young girlfriends?”
“Those harlots.” she says.. “Those sly little ducklings.”
“Ma’am?”
“The two blonds and the brunette. I’ve heard their names before, but I can never keep them straight. I only remember men’s names. Oh, wait! One interesting thing happened. Usually, the ducklings walk and stay in Dante’s for hours. This time… oh, it was around… 7.45, 7.50-ish… A car roared down the street. It was a beautiful green Chrysler Phaeton. A man dashed out of it, too fast for me to get a good look, but he ran inside and came out with one of the ducklings in tow.”
“Which one?” I ask.
“Oh… um… one of the blondes, I think. It all happened so fast, and my eyesight is not what it used to be. That’s why I normally rely on these.” She points at a pair of army surplus binoculars.
“How did you manage to get hold of those?” Harry asks.
“Oh, an old suitor – one of many, I don’t mind telling you – brought them back from the Great War. Now, the point is, I didn’t have time to get them when the car zipped by. Hmmm… There was something else. Something that didn’t happen today. Was it yesterday? I don’t quite remember. Oh well, I suppose you’ll just have to come and see me again tomorrow – won’t you, Sergeant Handsome Harry?”
She winks, and to my surprise, Harry takes her left hand, plants a very delicate kiss on her knuckles and says, “It would be my pleasure.”
I give him a sideways glance on our way down the stairs. “She reminds me of my mother, sir.”

# 6-4869: Bloomingdale Taxicabs
Fortunately, cab companies are open all hours of the night.  We stopped into the Bloomingdale Taxicabs company to see if anyone recognized Sam Babin.
I introduce myself to the shift manager, flicking my badge out. ““Detective Lt. Lockwood. I’m looking for information on a Sam Babin. He may be a regular client of yours.”
Somewhere behind me, Harry is already making new friends. Guess he’s got a knack.
The shift manager recognises my description of Sam Babin.
“Not exactly a major butter-and-egg man, our Sam, but we do well enough by him. He’s a gumshoe I hear.. Why are you looking for him?”
I don’t answer.
The manager clears his throat and carries on, “We keep pretty extensive records. How far back do you want me to go?”
“Just the last month would be fine.”
He returns from the back room with a large black book.  “Looks like he travels from the Dufton boarding houses on Broadway to the Downing Street Apartments about once a week for the last month. Also, he’s been taking a cab regularly down to the Gashouse District – just driving all over the place. Then a week ago, he starts frequenting a bar down there on 1st Avenue in the Gashouse district. Looks like he’s paying the cabbie waiting for him outside – can’t say I blame him; you don’t wanna get stranded there, am I right? Uh. Anyway, he pays the cabbie to wait, and then gets taken straight to the Greenwich Police Station for a brief stop, not sure what that’s about, and then back to his office at Glynn’s. Does that help?”
“Thank you for your cooperation.”

# 7-5485: Dufton and Brother Boarding Houses
We explain to the Dufton brothers that Sam Babin’s been shot, and that we need to get access to his room, but it’s no good.  Maybe someone in the Dufton family is a lawyer -- they won’t let us in without a warrant. I try a different tact.
“How long has Mr. Babin been saying here?” I ask.
“About two months” says the brother closest to me.
“And what do you know about him?” I ask.  I don’t know where I’m going with this but we’ve got nothing to lose.
“I know he was fired from his last job” says the Dufort brother in the back the room.  “We were drinking and he said his boss was a bastard who falsely accused him of something cray and fired him on the spot without any evidence.”
“Oh yeah? And did he say where this was?”
“I don’t remember the name.  I think he said it was some private investigation outfit in the Financial District.. On Nassau street I think.”
# 7-4184: Downing Street Apartment 4b

# 7-7336: Greenwich Village Police Precinct 
$havetag(samtaxi) then $jumplead()
The holding cells that occupy the basement of the station are ironically some of our cleanest rooms.  The rooms upstairs are cluttered by desks, cabinets, battered chairs and bodies that reek of sweat and cheap cigarettes. Down here in the basement, your nose gets whacked with the sharp odour of disinfectant. I like it. It reassures me that the cleaner cares for her profession, cares that she’s making a difference by keeping this corner of the world clean. Brings a smile to my face.
On nights like this one – those rare nights when the holding cells are as empty as a church on Mondays – I know that Lt. Eric Marsh, who runs undercover operations for the precinct, likes to sit down here to keep company with his thoughts. I’m not wrong.
“Give us a minute,” I whisper to Harry.
Eric is built along the same lines as Harry, but he packs more muscle, and a brain that’s older, stronger and matured – like whiskey but less toxic. In short, he’s a brainy giant.
I take a seat beside him, and we sit in silence for a minute.
“Why are you here, Malcolm?”
“I’m trying to figure out why a Private Investigator would be making regular stops here at the precinct”
“The one who got his ticket punched earlier tonight?”
“That’s the one. I’ve got him at a bar in the Gashouse district and then coming here.  Why would he do that, Eric?”
Eric sighs, “Why does anyone do what they do?”
“Eric, do we have someone working undercover in the Shrunken Head bar?”
Eric says nothing.
“I’m wondering,” I carry on, “whether Sam Babin might not have recognised an undercover cop or informant hanging around Otto’s, and followed him back here. His kind are good at remembering faces.”
Eric says nothing.
“I’m wondering if it might not be a sixteen-year-old girl, Eric.”
“I’m not giving you any names,” Eric replies, voice like a dry twig.
“I don’t think I need one. Alice Ayala.”
Eric says nothing, and that’s all the answer I need.
“See you later, Eric.”

We stop into the precinct for a quick cup of coffee then head back out.
# 8-2014: Mount Morris Bank
“What are you taking notes on, Sergeant?”
“Just writing down tips on how to beg, wheedle, cajole, threaten and coax bank managers this time of night, sir. You have a knack, make no mistake about it.”
I make no reply while we wait for a clerk from Mount Morris Bank to bring their files on Sam Babin.
“Mr Bain… No, Babin… Yes, Mr Babin had a less than stellar reputation with us.”
“What does that mean?” I ask, “He was in debt?”
“Like a pig in muck – if you’ll pardon my farmyard metaphor. Does that further your inquiries?”
“It might. What else can you tell us?”
The clerk frowns.  “If you ask me a specific question I shall try to answer it as best I can.”
Harry snorts.
“I’m curious about Mr Babin’s demeanour.” I reply, “Did he seem particularly troubled about being in debt?”
My new friend smiles. “As it happens, officer, I can share that Mr Babin recently consulted a colleague of mine who, in turn, shared during our lunch break that Mr Babin seemed intoxicated and was quite loquacious about an upturn in his financial prospects. Apparently the term golden goose was used.”
“Thank you for your time,” I say.
Harry snorts again as we depart. “What exactly have we learned, sir?”
“Much.”

# 8-2751: Dante’s
It’s nearly 8pm when we arrive at Dante’s. It’s a different beast from the Cosy Cadence. No siren on the stage here. No stage at all. Just an open space next to the bar. Loud clacking sounds call my attention to a young woman, standing in that open space, wearing a dress so heavily beaded that every movement cries out in a chorus of click-clacks. She throws her arms to the ceiling and recites a poem of some kind.
I sidle up to the barkeep, who slips a greasy grin my way. “Lieutenant! Good to you see ya. Celebrating your little art showing, are ya? Whatcha want to drink? Still no alcohol?”
He’s a wiry man with a walrus moustache under bushy eyebrows and a bald head.
“Nothing tonight, Malebranche. I’m on a case. No rest for you know.  I’m looking for two dames that go by Effy and Claire. You know them?”
He nods towards a small round table in a dim back corner. “Regulars,” he whispers. “Good tippers. No trouble. No high jumpers. Just decent Janes.”
One of the women sports blond, wavy hair that tumbles to her shoulders – an unusual length for this day and age. The hair goes with a face that’s appealing but not exactly suited for magazine covers. Her chin is a little weak, her nose slightly crooked, but she carries herself as if the flaws only enhance her appeal. Good for her. For some reason, I mark her as Effy immediately, which makes her friend Claire. Her brown hair is short, curling around her jawline as if hugging it for comfort – like that actress whose name I always forget. Claire sports a full mouth that quivers in time with her right hand.
Harry catches my attention and whispers, “Sir, you want me to separate them?”
I smile. “Good thinking, Sergeant. Get their stories independent of each other? Not this time. Let’s see what they say together. Watch ‘em closely. Remember, we know something they don’t.”
The two women have noticed us eyeing them and Effy quirks a golden eyebrow, so I walk over and introduce myself with my badge. Harry and I take a seat, but the small table forces us into close quarters with our interviewees.
“Effy Lempicka – Miss Effy Lempicka,” the blonde announces. Her smirk never falters, and I wonder if it’s a mask. Her friend’s right hand is still jittering.
“Claartje Blaak,” the brunette says, pronouncing her first name in a way that makes no sense to my ears, “but you can call me Claire.”  Thank god.
Harry reacts to their names. His foot kicks my ankle clumsily, and I see Miss Lempicka flick her sharp brown eyes towards him. His poker face needs work, especially around her. She’s no fool.
“The two of you are waiting for Sam Babin.” I make it a statement, not a question.
Miss Blaak’s eyes widen, but Lempicka speaks up: “We are.” She offers me a cigarette, and I decline while she lights up.
“Why?” I ask.
Lempicka looks at Blaak and allows her to speak. I get the feeling that allow is just the right word for their relationship.
“Inspiration,” Blaak says. “I’m a novelist – a detective novelist. I’m doing a character study and I need inspiration, so I need to talk to real people with real stories. Sam Babin is a Private Investigator, and he’s full of colorful stories.”
Harry chips in, “Inspiration? That’s all?”
Miss Blaak meets his eyes with a cold smile. “He’ll be here soon. You can ask him yourself.”
“What about you, Miss Lempicka?” I ask.
“Please call me Effy, Lieutenant. My interests align with my friend’s. Only, instead of writing novels, I write for The New Yorker.”
“Reporter?” I ask.
“Gossip columnist,” Harry interjects. “Muck-raker!”
Miss Lempicka keeps her eyes on me, reacting to the insult like a statue does to pigeons. “Yes, Lieutenant, and I often shadow my novelist friend here. Real stories are my stock-in-trade too, and I can strike a vein anywhere.”   
I catch Harry’s eye and nod.
He asks the vital question. “So, Sam Babin is coming here to meet the two of you?”
“No,” Effy replies. “There’s another regular girl here – a real high jumper, but Sam likes her. Really likes her, if you know what I mean, but I can never remember her name, and I don’t see her around just now. Guess she likes stories too. The whole city is full of addicts. Whatcha gonna do?” She holds my eyes for a full minute. I don’t look away, but I’m itching to.
“Can you remember what this woman looks like?” I ask, still holding her gaze.
“Beautiful,” she answers. “In an… unusual way. Blonde hair, like mine, but short and curly, like Claire’s.”
I notice Miss Blaak’s eyes widen before she recomposes her features into a stolid smile.
I rise and put my fedora back on my head. “Thank you for your cooperation. Please do not leave town. We may want to talk with you again.”
“Speaking for myself,” Effy replies. “I look forward to a second interview. The innocent have nothing to fear, right, Lieutenant?”
“Sir,” Harry hisses while we walk towards the door. “I know those two!”
“I know, Sergeant, and they know you know.”
He blushes. “Sorry, sir. Thing is, sir, those two are always writing about how dumb and corrupt the police are. She’s made some of the boys at the station look pretty bad.  I’d be careful what you say to her, you don’t want it ending up in print.”
“I’ll take it under advisement, Harry.” I say.
“They didn’t know Sam had gotten shot”, he says.
“You sure about that?”, I ask, raising an eyebrow.  “Something’s not right about these two, and I’d like to know a little bit more about who we’re dealing with. Coroner’s report won’t be available until tomorrow. Until then, we’ve still got work to do.”

# ClaartjeReinterview: Re-interviewing Claartje Blaak (autoid=true)
“She’s not home.” Danny the doorman is standing behind us. After a second, I realise that my mouth is hanging open. The big man can move like a ghost, and I start to wonder how he would handle himself in a fight.
“Did you see where she went, Danny?” Harry asks, his tone gentle.
Danny nods. “A man came round to pick her up, about ten minutes ago. I don’t know his name. Looked like a real butter-and-egg man – tailored suit and polished shoes. Handsome type – chin as big as a clenched fist. Blonde hair. Blue eyes. She went with him willingly, and she mentioned being spooked over the death of Sam Babin. She got into a green Chrysler Phaeton.”
“Got the plates?” I ask.
“Yes, officer.” He sounds offended that I would even suggest otherwise. “9X 6767”.
“Good man. Harry, have someone at the station check those plates for us tomorrow. Now Danny, open her room, please,” I instruct him, and he complies.
Claire’s rooms are cluttered with stacks of paper, each with a neatly printed card: ON ICE, POSSIBLE MOTIVES, CHARACTER PROFILES, PLOT IDEAS, CHARACTER ARCS, and others.
Pride of place is given to a desk under a broad window facing Dante’s, where a typewriter waits, looking hungry as a cat.
“Nothing out of the ordinary?” Harry asks.
“How should I know?” Danny replies. “I’m not up here regularly.”
I sidle up to one of the tallest stacks of papers, marked POSSIBLE MOTIVES. It’s been subdivided into categories including BLACKMAIL – SEE ALSO GREED; SOCIAL STATUS; MORAL SELF-JUSTIFICATION; MADNESS (USE SPARINGLY). It would take hours to read through it all.

# NewYorker (warning=pending, section=Main.Errata)
“Bedlam!” Harry exclaims from his chair next to mine. “Reporters are crazier than cops!”
I turn and follow his gaze. He’s peering out the glass windows of the office belonging to Thomas Delaney – Editor-in-Chief of The New Yorker. From this vantage point, we look down on an anthill of frenetic activity in the news room below. It resembles the police station: crammed with desks and bodies jostling about, smelling of sweat and cigarettes.
“My uncle is a beekeeper,” Harry comments. “The reporters down there make a beehive look like a holiday resort.”
“My empire!” a voice announces behind us, and Mr Delaney strides into his office. He takes a seat behind a huge desk that is, contrary to all my expectations, neatly ordered. “Never a dull moment!” Mr Delaney bellows, a cigar balancing precariously between his teeth. “What can I do for the law, today?” He leans forward, resting his narrow chin on his hands. Huge, round spectacles encircle glittering brown eyes. He makes me feel like I’m being measured for a story.
I say, “Miss Effy Lempicka works for you.”
Mr Delaney emits a plume of smoke, his eyes brimming with pride. “Yes! She sure does. Bright mind, sharp tongue, sharper vocabulary – and a nose for insalubrious chatter. She’s a talent, an earner and thus a keeper. Why? What’s your interest in her?”
“We need her real name” I say.
“What makes you think Lempicka isn’t her real name?”
“Effy Lempicka doesn’t exist. She’s not in the system. We figure it’s a nom de plume.”
“I can’t give you her real name.” he says, but Harry’s picked up on the hesitance in his voice.
“You *can* give us her real name” says Harry. “A man’s been murdered.”
Delaney shrugs and gives up without a fight. “Fine.  Efimiya Uvarova. You’re talking about the death of that PI, right? You got a warrant for her arrest?” His eyes are flicking between our faces like fingers on a typewriter – still searching for a story.  I can’t tell if he’s concerned for his employee or just wants a heads up about a possible photo opportunity. “Care to make a comment for the press?”
“No comment,” says Harry.

# End-of-day briefing for Day 1 (section=Briefings)
I had to pull some slippery strings to get this case assigned to me, so I guess it’s only fair that I endure the required debriefing. 
1. 	“Let’s see,” the Chief of Police asks over the cigar clamped between his yellowing teeth. “This note here mentions Dante’s. You went there, didn’t you?”
 
2. 	“You did notice the… um, coincidence of where the persons of interest from Dante’s live, right? Personally, I don’t much like coincidences. They make me suspicious.”  
 
3. 	“You met some persons of interest at Dante’s. Good, good. And you checked in with the doorman at their apartment building, right?”
 
4. 	“Did you re-interview those persons of interest from Dante’s at their apartments? Sometimes it’s no bad idea to try suspects again, especially those who proved less than truthful the first time around.”
 
5. 	“That gossip columnist you met at Dante’s; did you consider talking to her employer?”
 
6. 	“If the person, or persons, who hired Sam Babin live in Greenwich Village, it might be worth checking in with the local bank. Of course, you’d have to solicit records on a specific account. Bankers can be so funny about protecting their clients’ privacy.”
 
7. 	“On the subject of privacy. You stopped by the Hall of Records, I assume? I mean, what do people hire PIs for if not for private matters? The Hall of Records can be a cop’s best friend now and again, unless some civil servant made a hash of their paperwork.”
 
8. 	“If you were looking for someone who caught a cab just before you could interview said person, you could try and contact the taxi company. You did that, right?”
 
9. 	“You did think to talk to people across the street from the Downing Street Apartments, in case anyone saw anything?”

# Start of Day 2 decision (section=Briefings)
Day 2 of the investigation is about to start. Does Lt. Malcolm Lockwood:
 1) find Archie Babin at the Greenwich Police Precinct, and tell him the truth about why his brother Sam was murdered (read Scene 1 below)?
 2) drive to the Downing Street Apartments to say good morning to Effy instead (read Scene 2 below)?

Scene 1
“You are a class-A idiot, Malcolm.” I don’t usually talk to myself out loud; certainly not in public. “Then again, it’s going to be a rough day with a rough start.” 
It’s not my responsibility to break the news to Archie about his brother perpetrating blackmail. I’m not sure why I’m doing it. But here I am, standing at the tiny bodega across from the precinct with two cups of coffee. There’s Archie. He sees me and trots over.
“You wanted to see me, LT.” His voice is rougher than usual; his face placid. I figure he’s doing his stoic big brother act, refusing to show how the murder is affecting him. 
I offer one of the coffees to him. 
“Archie, I wanted you to get this from me instead of the grapevine.” I’m talking faster than usual and I can’t slow down. “I’m going to give it to you in one dose. Sam was blackmailing one of his clients. He’d learned something dangerous, and he decided to extort money from them.” 
Archie’s eyes light up with anger. He glares at me, then past me. His mouth opens and closes. His body goes rigid like a soldier on parade. “Will that be all, LT? I have duties that need doing?”
He departs without waiting for me to answer, leaving me with the feeling that I’ve lost an almost-friend and a reliable contact – neither of which seem to matter much right now. Just outside the entrance to the precinct, I see him throw the coffee into a trashcan. 

Scene 2
“You are a class-A idiot, Malcolm.” I don’t usually talk to myself out loud; certainly not in public. “Why’d you spill your guts to Effy like that?” 
The more important question is: why am I standing in the lobby of the Downing Street Apartments with two takeaway cups of coffee and some croissants? 
I spot Effy descending the stairs, and despite masterfully-applied makeup, it’s clear she’s operating on insufficient sleep. 
“Dear Malcolm,” she says upon reaching me, but her voice is less cheerful than yesterday. “Are you here to amaze me with your deductive prowess?” 
“Um,” I reply, feeling as if the floor tiles are shifting under my feet. “What do you mean?”
“Ah. So you don’t know. Good. You’re human. Mr Glynn called me last night after you and Sgt. Stone left. He threatened to kill me if I was involved in Sam Babin’s death.” She smiles as if she’d won some lottery. 
I take a second to process the information, but before I can reply, Effy heads me off: “Any comments for The New Yorker, Malcolm?”
“What about a quiet coffee before the madness of a new day kicks off?”
She takes one of the coffees and one croissant. “Maybe next time. There’s a world of gossip to track down and, apparently, at least one man who wants me dead.” 
As she exits the lobby, I turn to the reception desk to see Danny giving me a flat look. 
“Want coffee and a croissant, Danny?”  
“Fine,” he growls. “Someone should have it.” Danny frowns at me. “You look… upset, officer.”
I frown back at him, suddenly angry without knowing why. “Thank you for your cooperation,” I mumble, and leave – forcing myself to walk slowly.  
Harry is waiting for me at the station, grinning stupidly, while holding two cups of coffee. “Good morning, Lieutenant!” he calls before I’m even out of the car. I count to ten. My heart rate slows. When I get out, I’m grateful for the cold morning air.  
“Morning Sergeant. We have work to do.”
