I\u2019ve heard their names before, but I can never keep them straight. I only remember men\u2019s names. They\u2019re always partying across the way on the 4th floor, I can see them from here,\u201d she says, pointing out her window.\n\u201cThree girls, not two? You\u2019re sure about that?\u201d Harry asks.\n\u201cThree *HARLOTS*\u201d she emphasises. Harry and I exchange a glance.\n\u201cAnd why do you call them harlots?\u201d I ask. \n\u201cThey\u2019re always meeting with some slick looking fella outside, showing him nasty photos, acting sneaky.  Always giving him slips of paper.  Up to no good, they are.  Nasty little ducklings.\u201d  We describe Sam Babin to her and she seems to confirm he\u2019s the guy in question.\n\u201cAnything else you\u2019ve noticed?\u201d I ask.\n\u201cLet me think\u2026 Well one interesting thing happened. Usually, the ducklings walk over to Dante\u2019s and spend the whole evening there. This time\u2026 oh, it was around\u2026 7.45, 7.50-ish\u2026 A car roared down the street. It was a beautiful green Chrysler Phaeton. A man dashed out of it, a different man from the one with the photos you understand, but too fast for me to get a good look at him. He ran inside and came out with one of the ducklings in tow.\u201d\n\u201cWhich one?\u201d I ask.\n\u201cOh\u2026 um\u2026 one of the blondies, I think. It all happened so fast, and my eyesight is not what it used to be. That\u2019s why I normally rely on these.\u201d She points at a pair of army surplus binoculars.\n\u201cHow did you manage to get hold of those?\u201d Harry asks.\n\u201cOh, an old suitor \u2013 one of many, I don\u2019t mind telling you \u2013 brought them back from the Great War. Now, the point is, I didn\u2019t have time to get them when the car zipped by. Hmmm\u2026 There was something else. Something that didn\u2019t happen today. Was it yesterday? I don\u2019t quite remember. Well, Sergeant Handsome Harry, if you come by tomorrow for lunch I\u2019ll make you a nice bowl of Chicken soup and we can talk more about it.\u201d\nShe winks, and to my surprise, Harry takes her left hand, plants a very delicate kiss on her knuckles and says, \u201cIt would be my pleasure.\u201d\nI give him a sideways glance on our way down the stairs. \u201cShe reminds me of my mother, sir.\u201d\n",

You\u2019re sure about that?\u201d Harry asks.\n\u201cThree *HARLOTS*\u201d she emphasises. Harry and I exchange a glance.\n\u201cAnd why do you call them harlots?\u201d I ask. \n\u201cThey\u2019re always meeting with some slick looking fella outside, showing him nasty photos, acting sneaky.  Always giving him slips of paper.  Up to no good, they are.  Nasty little ducklings.\u201d  We describe Sam Babin to her and she seems to confirm he\u2019s the guy in question.\n\u201cAnything else you\u2019ve noticed?\u201d I ask.\n\u201cLet me think\u2026 Well one interesting thing happened. Usually, the ducklings walk over to Dante\u2019s and spend the whole evening there. This time\u2026 oh, it was around\u2026 7.45, 7.50-ish\u2026 A car roared down the street. It was a beautiful green Chrysler Phaeton. A man dashed out of it, a different man from the one with the photos you understand, but too fast for me to get a good look at him. He ran inside and came out with one of the ducklings in tow.\u201d\n\u201cWhich one?\u201d I ask.\n\u201cOh\u2026 um\u2026 one of the blondies, I think. It all happened so fast, and my eyesight is not what it used to be. That\u2019s why I normally rely on these.\u201d She points at a pair of army surplus binoculars.\n\u201cHow did you manage to get hold of those?\u201d Harry asks.\n\u201cOh, an old suitor \u2013 one of many, I don\u2019t mind telling you \u2013 brought them back from the Great War. Now, the point is, I didn\u2019t have time to get them when the car zipped by. Hmmm\u2026 There was something else. Something that didn\u2019t happen today. Was it yesterday? I don\u2019t quite remember. Well, Sergeant Handsome Harry, if you come by tomorrow for lunch I\u2019ll make you a nice bowl of Chicken soup and we can talk more about it.\u201d\nShe winks, and to my surprise, Harry takes her left hand, plants a very delicate kiss on her knuckles and says, \u201cIt would be my pleasure.\u201d\nI give him a sideways glance on our way down the stairs. \u201cShe reminds me of my mother, sir.\u201d\n* You have gained the condition D; please circle this letter in your records for later use (if you have not done so already).",

Moreover, he\u2019s smart enough to notice us eyeing him, but we flash our badges and step close. \n\u201cMy brother sent you, didn\u2019t he?\u201d Sam Babin sighs. \u201cYou hoping to set me on the straight and narrow?\u201d His eyes return to the singer.  \n\u201cLet\u2019s talk outside,\u201d I say. \u201cFewer distractions.\u201d \nSam reluctantly walks outside with us, mumbling something about an appointment. \u201cWhat do you fellas want?\u201d\n\u201cYou on a case?\u201d I ask.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it to you, mister?\u201d\nHarry chips in, \u201cFirst of all, you call him Lieutenant Lockwood, and you call me Sergeant Stone, got it? And second of all, we\u2019re here as a favor to your brother, pal. He says you\u2019re in trouble.\u201d I can sense a little anger in his voice -- I guess he doesn\u2019t like being disrespected.\nSam rolls his eyes. \u201cLook fellas, go tell my big brother I don\u2019t need him to play guardian angel. He can mind his own business -- and so can you. I\u2019ve got a cab to catch.\u201d\nHarry flexes his knuckles and takes a step towards Sam, but I put an arm across his chest. \u201cNow, now, we\u2019re all friends here\u201d, I say, and to Harry, I whisper, \u201cRemember why we\u2019re here.\u201d \nSam smiles nervously then turns and hurries off down West 94th Street.\nI turn towards my car with Harry in tow. He starts to say something when I hear a car backfire behind us. No. Not a backfire! I turn and see Sam Babin\u2019s body crumpled in a pool of light from the streetlamp. There\u2019s no one standing around him. No one on the opposite side of the street. All the traffic lights are green, and cars are speeding by.\nI race towards Sam, find his wrist and feel for a pulse. Nothing. Blood stains his white shirt.\n\u201cShot,\u201d Harry breathes. He looks around for witnesses. Good kid. But there\u2019s no one.\nI quickly rummage through Sam\u2019s coat, and the inside pocket yields a note.\n",

Maybe he has issues. \nShe meets us like a diplomat expecting an international incident.\n\u201cGentlemen, come on in.\u201d For a second, she bars the way into her sitting room as if challenging me to shoulder past, but I wait. She smiles even wider before taking a short step back, and I smell her perfume on the way in.  \nUvarova\u2019s apartment is modest, but neat and ordered. I figure it reflects the precise, ordered nature of her mind. She\u2019s got coffee ready; seems like she was expecting us.  Or someone else.  She passes a cup to Harry and one to me. The gesture doesn\u2019t melt the ice in Harry\u2019s eyes. There\u2019s a tiny kitchenette in an alcove off the sitting room, just like my apartment \u2013 and like mine, her heating doesn\u2019t seem to work so well.\nHarry takes the lead, like we\u2019d planned. \u201cYou lied to us at Dante\u2019s. You know Denice Ayala. She walked into Dante\u2019s with you and Claire, but when we showed up, she was gone. Where did she go?\u201d \n\u201cI hear,\u201d she responds, \u201cthat Mr Babin was shot. It was on the radio. Pity\u2026\u201d\n\u201cStop,\u201d Harry says in a low voice. \u201cTell us the truth before something bad happens to someone else. Why were you and Denice meeting with Sam? Where is Denice now?\u201d\n\u201cIf I didn\u2019t know any better, I would call that a bad case of foreshadowing. You know what that is?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, it means you know something.\u201d\nUvarova laughs and it\u2019s\u2026 well it\u2019s not an unpleasant sound.\nHarry grinds his teeth then opens his mouth, but she heads him off and looks at me. \u201cLt. Lockwood, I will speak with you alone.  Your sergeant can wait in the lobby.\u201d  \nIt\u2019s Harry\u2019s turn to laugh his booming laugh, but I say nothing and lock eyes with him until he gets it. His face falls, but then he frowns and\u2026 I can\u2019t figure out what he\u2019s thinking, but he looks at Uvarova and back at me. An honest smile twists his lips, and he exits the room.\nUvarova seats herself on a plush armchair. She\u2019s wearing a red dressing gown that covers her from neck to ankle. She offers me a cigarette, which I decline.\n\u201cYou look like a gin and tonic man,\u201d she says.\n\u201cI don\u2019t drink\u201d\nShe frowns. \u201cPity. Either way, I\u2019m willing to trade information, Lieutenant.\u201d\n\u201cName your price, Miss Uvarova.\u201d\nShe holds up three fingers. \u201cFirst \u2013 call \u2013 me \u2013 Effy. Second, from now on, I want to call you by your first name. Third, I want you to tell me something about yourself. Something\u2026 personal.\u201d She draws the word out as if it tasted sweet in her mouth.\n\u201cYou planning to write about me?\u201d\nShe smirks, \u201cNot this time. I\u2019ll give you one free pass.\u201d  \n\u201cAlright, Effy.\u201d Talking to her feels good, though I can\u2019t say why. \u201cCall me Malcolm. I paint in my free time - portraits mostly. I\u2019m not great, but better than some.\u201d\n\u201cWhat kinds of people do you paint?\u201d\n\u201cHow about you share some information and I'll tell you next time?\u201d \nShe purses her lips and lifts her hands, palms-up, imitating scales, bobbing them up and down, up and down. \u201cAlright, but I\u2019ll keep you to that promise.\u201d She puts out her cigarette in an ashtray.   \u201cCall Martinez-Plough\u2019s Gallery. Speak to Violet Tomlin. She\u2019s one of several secretaries for the owner of the gallery. Tell her you\u2019re a detective. She thinks you\u2019re the most romantic creatures alive. Ask her about Denice. Obviously, don\u2019t call right now. Wait until tomorrow. It\u2019s laughably late. Speaking of which, I need my beauty sleep. Girl\u2019s gotta work tomorrow.\u201d\nSuddenly feeling as out of place as a clown at a hair salon, I make my departure.\nHarry is waiting for me in the lobby downstairs. \u201cWell, sir?\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d I say, putting my hat back on my head, \u201cwe got a lead.\u201d\n",

His face falls, but then he frowns and\u2026 I can\u2019t figure out what he\u2019s thinking, but he looks at Uvarova and back at me. An honest smile twists his lips, and he exits the room.\nUvarova seats herself on a plush armchair. She\u2019s wearing a red dressing gown that covers her from neck to ankle. She offers me a cigarette, which I decline.\n\u201cYou look like a gin and tonic man,\u201d she says.\n\u201cI don\u2019t drink\u201d\nShe frowns. \u201cPity.

Something\u2026 personal.\u201d She draws the word out as if it tasted sweet in her mouth.\n\u201cYou planning to write about me?\u201d\nShe smirks, \u201cNot this time. I\u2019ll give you one free pass.\u201d  \n\u201cAlright, Effy.\u201d Talking to her feels good, though I can\u2019t say why. \u201cCall me Malcolm. I paint in my free time - portraits mostly. I\u2019m not great, but better than some.\u201d\n\u201cWhat kinds of people do you paint?\u201d\n\u201cHow about you share some information and I'll tell you next time?\u201d \nShe purses her lips and lifts her hands, palms-up, imitating scales, bobbing them up and down, up and down. \u201cAlright, but I\u2019ll keep you to that promise.\u201d She puts out her cigarette in an ashtray.   \u201cCall Martinez-Plough\u2019s Gallery. Speak to Violet Tomlin. She\u2019s one of several secretaries for the owner of the gallery. Tell her you\u2019re a detective. She thinks you\u2019re the most romantic creatures alive. Ask her about Denice. Obviously, don\u2019t call right now. Wait until tomorrow. It\u2019s laughably late. Speaking of which, I need my beauty sleep. Girl\u2019s gotta work tomorrow.\u201d\nSuddenly feeling as out of place as a clown at a hair salon, I make my departure.\nHarry is waiting for me in the lobby downstairs. \u201cWell, sir?\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d I say, putting my hat back on my head, \u201cwe got a lead.\u201d",

She smiles even wider before taking a short step back, and I smell her perfume on the way in.  \nUvarova\u2019s apartment is modest, but neat and ordered. I figure it reflects the precise, ordered nature of her mind. She\u2019s got coffee ready; seems like she was expecting us.  Or someone else.  She passes a cup to Harry and one to me. The gesture doesn\u2019t melt the ice in Harry\u2019s eyes. There\u2019s a tiny kitchenette in an alcove off the sitting room, just like my apartment \u2013 and like mine, her heating doesn\u2019t seem to work so well.\nHarry takes the lead, like we\u2019d planned. \u201cYou lied to us at Dante\u2019s.

Still no alcohol?\u201d\nHe\u2019s a wiry man with a walrus moustache under bushy eyebrows and a bald head.\n\u201cNothing tonight, Malebranche. I\u2019m on a case. No rest for us.

No trouble. Just decent Janes.\u201d\nOne of the women sports blond, wavy hair that tumbles to her shoulders \u2013 an unusual length for this day and age. The hair goes with a face that\u2019s appealing but not exactly suited for magazine covers. Her chin is a little weak, her nose slightly crooked, but she carries herself as if the flaws enhance her appeal. Good for her. For some reason, I mark her as Effy immediately. Her friend\u2019s brown hair is short, curling around her jawline as if hugging it for comfort \u2013 like that actress whose name I always forget. \nHarry catches my attention and whispers, \u201cSir, you want me to separate them?\u201d\nI smile. \u201cGood thinking, Sergeant. Get their stories independent of each other? Not this time. Let\u2019s see what they say together. Watch \u2018em closely. Remember, we know something they don\u2019t.\u201d\nThe two women have noticed us eyeing them and Effy quirks a golden eyebrow, so I walk over and introduce myself with my badge. Harry and I take a seat, but the small table forces us into close quarters with them.\n\u201cEffy Uvarova \u2013 Miss Effy Uvarova,\u201d the blonde announces. Her smirk never falters, and I wonder if it\u2019s a mask. Her friend starts chewing her own bottom lip.\n\u201cClaartje Blaak,\u201d the brunette says, pronouncing her first name in a way that makes no sense to my ears, \u201cbut you can call me Claire.\u201d  Thank god.\nHarry reacts to their names. His foot kicks my ankle clumsily, and I see Miss Uvarova flick her sharp brown eyes towards him. His poker face needs work, especially around her. She\u2019s no fool.\n\u201cThe two of you are waiting for Sam Babin.\u201d I make it a statement, not a question.\nMiss Blaak\u2019s eyes widen, but Uvarova speaks up: \u201cWe are.\u201d She offers me a cigarette, and I decline while she lights up.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d I ask.\nUvarova looks at Blaak and allows her to speak. I get the feeling that allow is just the right word for their relationship.\n\u201cInspiration,\u201d Blaak says. \u201cI\u2019m a novelist \u2013 a detective novelist. I\u2019m doing a character study and I need inspiration, so I need to talk to real people with real stories. Sam Babin is a Private Investigator, and he\u2019s full of colourful stories.\u201d\nHarry chips in, \u201cInspiration? That\u2019s all?\u201d\nMiss Blaak meets his eyes with a cold smile that\u2019s completely at odds with the nervousness I spotted earlier. \u201cHe\u2019ll be here soon. You can ask him yourself.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about you, Miss Uvarova ?\u201d I ask.\n\u201cPlease call me Effy, Lieutenant. My interests align with my friend\u2019s. Only, instead of writing novels, I write for The Daily Mirror.\u201d\n\u201cReporter?\u201d I ask.\n\u201cGossip columnist,\u201d Harry interjects. \u201cMuck-raker!\u201d\nMiss Uvarova keeps her eyes on me, reacting to the insult like a statue does to pigeons. \u201cYes, Lieutenant, and I often shadow my novelist friend here. Real stories are my stock-in-trade too.\u201d    \nI catch Harry\u2019s eye and nod.\nHe asks the vital question. \u201cSo, Sam Babin is coming here to meet the two of you?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Effy replies. \u201cThere\u2019s another regular girl here. I can never remember her name, and I don\u2019t see her around just now. Guess she likes stories too.\u201d She holds my eyes for a full minute. I don\u2019t look away, but I\u2019m itching to.\n\u201cCan you remember what this woman looks like?\u201d I ask, still holding her gaze.\n\u201cBeautiful,\u201d she answers. \u201cIn an\u2026 unusual way. Blonde hair, like mine, but short and curly, like Claire\u2019s.\u201d\nI notice Miss Blaak\u2019s eyes widen before she recomposes her features into a stolid smile.\nI rise and put my fedora back on my head. \u201cThank you for your cooperation. Please do not leave town. We may want to talk with you again.\u201d\n\u201cSpeaking for myself,\u201d Effy replies. \u201cI look forward to a second interview. The innocent have nothing to fear, right, Lieutenant?\u201d\n\u201cSir,\u201d Harry hisses while we walk towards the door. \u201cI know those two!\u201d\n\u201cI know, Sergeant, and they know you know.\u201d\nHe blushes. \u201cSorry, sir. Thing is, those two are always writing about how dumb and corrupt the police are. Between them, they\u2019ve made some of the boys at the station look pretty bad.  I\u2019d be careful what you say to either of them.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll take it under advisement, Sergeant.\u201d \n\u201cThey didn\u2019t know Sam had been shot\u201d, he says.\n\u201cYou sure about that?\u201d, I ask, raising an eyebrow.  \u201cSomething\u2019s not right about these two, and I\u2019d like to know more about who we\u2019re dealing with. Coroner\u2019s report won\u2019t be available until tomorrow. Until then, we\u2019ve still got work to do.\u201d\n\n",

I get the feeling that allow is just the right word for their relationship.\n\u201cInspiration,\u201d Blaak says. \u201cI\u2019m a novelist \u2013 a detective novelist. I\u2019m doing a character study and I need inspiration, so I need to talk to real people with real stories.

No trouble. Just decent Janes.\u201d\nOne of the women sports blond, wavy hair that tumbles to her shoulders \u2013 an unusual length for this day and age. The hair goes with a face that\u2019s appealing but not exactly suited for magazine covers. Her chin is a little weak, her nose slightly crooked, but she carries herself as if the flaws enhance her appeal. Good for her. For some reason, I mark her as Effy immediately. Her friend\u2019s brown hair is short, curling around her jawline as if hugging it for comfort \u2013 like that actress whose name I always forget. \nHarry catches my attention and whispers, \u201cSir, you want me to separate them?\u201d\nI smile. \u201cGood thinking, Sergeant.
