He\u2019s handsome, I\u2019ll admit, in a sly, rakish sort of way. Moreover, he\u2019s smart enough to notice us eyeing him, but we flash our badges and take up station by his seat. \n\u201cMy brother sent you, didn\u2019t he?\u201d Sam Babin sighs. \u201cYou here to set me on the straight and narrow? Enlist me in the force, or something?\u201d\n\u201cFor a start,\u201d I half shout to make myself heard, \u201clet\u2019s get outside.

Current employment: secretary at Martinez-Plough's Gallery in Bloomingdale.\u201d\n \u201cI know them both,\u201d I say without thinking.\n \u201cYou know about art, sir?\u201d\n \u201cI wonder if anyone at Aliyev\u2019s will answer the horn at this time of night.\u201d\n\u201cWell look at this!\u201d Harry exclaims, loud enough to make me wince. \u201cOur Danny at Downing Street commanded an infantry regiment during the Great War. Fled to the US when the revolution kicked off. Good man, that.\u201d",

A man dashed out of it, too fast for me to get a good look, but he ran inside and came out with one of the ducklings in tow.\u201d\n \u201cWhich one?\u201d I ask.\n \u201cOh\u2026 um\u2026 one of the blondes, I think. It all happened so fast, and my eyesight is not what it used to be.

I don\u2019t quite remember. Oh well, I suppose you\u2019ll just have to come and see me again tomorrow \u2013 won\u2019t you, Sergeant Handsome Harry?\u201d\nShe winks, and to my surprise, Harry takes her left hand, plants a very delicate kiss on her knuckles and says, \u201cAs you wish, my lady.\u201d\n I give him a sideways glance on our way down the stairs. \u201cMy mother ran a beauty salon, sir.

She\u2019s even wearing a heavily beaded dress like the lady from Dante\u2019s.\n \u201cWell now, aren\u2019t you a handsome Joe,\u201d she says, winking at Harry. \u201cWhat can you do for me?\u201d\n \u201cWell, I, um...\u201d\n \u201cSilly me \u2013 I suppose the question is, what can I do for you?\u201d\nI take pity on the poor guy. \u201cDid you see anything of interest from your window overlooking the Downing Street Apartments?\u201d\n \u201cNothing unusual. The three ducklings went off to their hangout as they often do.\u201d\n \u201cDucklings, ma\u2019am?\u201d\n \u201cThe two blonds and the brunette. I\u2019ve heard their names before, but I can never keep them straight. I only remember men\u2019s names. Oh, wait! One interesting thing happened. Usually, the ducklings walk and stay in Dante\u2019s for hours. This time\u2026 oh, it was around\u2026 7.45, 7.50-ish\u2026 A car roared down the street. It was a beautiful green Chrysler Phaeton. A man dashed out of it, too fast for me to get a good look, but he ran inside and came out with one of the ducklings in tow.\u201d\n \u201cWhich one?\u201d I ask.\n \u201cOh\u2026 um\u2026 one of the blondes, I think. It all happened so fast, and my eyesight is not what it used to be. That\u2019s why I normally rely on these.\u201d She points at a pair of army surplus binoculars.\n \u201cHow did you manage to get hold of those?\u201d Harry asks.\n \u201cOh, an old suitor \u2013 one of many, I don\u2019t mind telling you \u2013 brought them back from the Great War. Now, the point is, I didn\u2019t have time to get them when the car zipped by. Hmmm\u2026 There was something else. Something that didn\u2019t happen today. Was it yesterday? I don\u2019t quite remember. Oh well, I suppose you\u2019ll just have to come and see me again tomorrow \u2013 won\u2019t you, Sergeant Handsome Harry?\u201d\nShe winks, and to my surprise, Harry takes her left hand, plants a very delicate kiss on her knuckles and says, \u201cAs you wish, my lady.\u201d\n I give him a sideways glance on our way down the stairs. \u201cMy mother ran a beauty salon, sir. It never hurts to be kind to people with eyes.",

Maybe he has issues. \n She meets us like a diplomat expecting an international incident. Her smile is still painted bright red, her makeup still undisturbed.\n \u201cGentlemen, come on in.\u201d For a second, she bars the way into her sitting room as if challenging me to shoulder past, but I wait. She smiles even wider before taking a short step back, and I smell her perfume on the way in.  \n Uvarova\u2019s apartment is modest, but neat and ordered \u2013 the way I think her mind is. Her sitting room confirms that she\u2019s been expecting us. She\u2019s got coffee on the go \u2013 bless her soul \u2013 and she passes a cup to Harry and me. The gesture doesn\u2019t melt the ice in Harry\u2019s eyes. She\u2019s got a tiny kitchenette in an alcove off the sitting room, just like my apartment \u2013 and like mine, her heating doesn\u2019t work so well.\n Harry takes the lead, like we\u2019d planned. \u201cYou lied to us at Dante\u2019s. Your real name is Efimiya Uvarova. You know Denice Ayala. All that jazz about you looking for stories and her just being some floozie Sam Babin fancied was pure drivel. Denice walked into Dante\u2019s with you and your friend, but when we showed up, she was gone. Where did she go?\u201d \n Uvarova raises her coffee cup to her lips. Harry refuses to drink his, but I\u2019m only mortal and I worship caffeine.\n \u201cI hear,\u201d she responds, \u201cthat Mr Babin\u2019s met his maker. It was on the radio. A pity\u2026\u201d\n \u201cStop,\u201d Harry says in a low voice. \u201cYou tell us the truth before something bad happens to someone else. Why did Denice Ayala and the rest of you meet with Sam? Where did Denice go?\u201d  \n \u201cIf I didn\u2019t know any better, Sergeant, I would call that a bad case of foreshadowing. You know what that is?\u201d\n \u201cTo my ears, it means you know something.\u201d\n Uvarova laughs and it\u2019s\u2026 well it\u2019s not an unpleasant sound. \u201cYou like talking, Sergeant. You trust your voice. Your lieutenant, however, is a laconic man. Know what that means?\u201d \n \u201cIt means he likes a gin and tonic,\u201d Harry grinds his teeth.\n Uvarova laughs again. Harry bristles and opens his bazoo, but she heads him off. \u201cLt. Lockwood, I will speak with you provided Sgt. Stone here quits the room. There\u2019s a decent enough waiting area downstairs. Denice and Claire and I spent many hours down there with Sam, under the watchful eye of our chivalrous doorman.\u201d  \n It\u2019s Harry\u2019s turn to laugh his booming laugh, but I say nothing and lock eyes with him until he gets it. His face falls, but then he frowns and\u2026 I can\u2019t figure out what he\u2019s thinking, but he looks at Uvarova and back at me. An honest smile twists his lips, and he exits the room.\n Uvarova seats herself on a plush armchair. Did I mention she\u2019s wearing a red dressing gown that covers her from neck to ankle? She offers me a cigarette, which I decline again.\n \u201cI will barter information, Lieutenant.\u201d\n \u201cWhat\u2019s your price, Miss Uvarova?\u201d\nShe holds up three fingers. \u201cFirst \u2013 call \u2013 me \u2013 Effy. Second, I want to call you by your first name. Third, I want you to tell me something about yourself \u2013 something personal.\u201d  \n \u201cAlright, Effy.\u201d I\u2019m talking before I know it. \u201cMy name is Malcolm. I was born here, as far as I know. Orphan. But I was raised in England. I received a top-notch education over the pond. I can paint. Not well, but better than some. Will that suffice?\u201d\n She purses her lips and lifts her hands, palms-up, imitating scales. Her hands bob up and down, up and down. \u201cFor now, yes. I will keep your name out of The New Yorker, but you should have made me promise before you talked. I\u2019ll be kind \u2013 this time. Now for your prize. Call Martinez-Plough\u2019s Gallery. Speak to Violet Tomlin. She\u2019s one of several secretaries for the owner of the gallery. Tell her you\u2019re a detective. She thinks you\u2019re the most romantic creatures alive. Ask her about Denice. Obviously, don\u2019t call right now. Wait until tomorrow. It\u2019s laughably late. Speaking of which, I need my beauty sleep. Girl\u2019s gotta work tomorrow.\u201d\n Suddenly feeling as out of place as a clown at a hair salon, I make my departure, but pause at the door. \u201cYou gave us a correct description of Denice when you could have lied.\u201d Effy does not respond. \u201cTo my mind, that suggests that you know \u2013 or think \u2013 she\u2019s in trouble.\u201d I head downstairs.\n Harry is waiting for me in the lobby downstairs. \u201cWell, sir?\u201d\n \u201cWe have a lead for tomorrow.\u201d\n\n",

Just an open space next to the bar. Loud clacking sounds call my attention to a young woman, standing in that open space, wearing a dress so heavily beaded that every movement cries out in a chorus of click-clacks. She throws her arms to the ceiling and recites a poem of some kind.   \n I sidle up to the barkeep, who slips a greasy grin my way. \u201cLieutenant! Good to you see ya. It\u2019s your night off, right? Whatcha want for a drink? Still no alcohol?\u201d   \n He\u2019s a wiry man with a walrus moustache under bushy eyebrows and a bald head.\n \u201cNothing tonight, Malebranche. I\u2019m on a case. No rest for the etc., etc. Effy and Claire. You know them?\u201d  \n He nods towards a small round table in a dim back corner. \u201cRegulars,\u201d he whispers. \u201cGood tippers. No trouble. No high jumpers. Just decent Janes.\u201d\n One of the women sports blond, wavy hair that tumbles to her shoulders \u2013 an unusual length for this day and age. The hair goes with a face that\u2019s appealing but not exactly suited for magazine covers. Her chin is a little weak, her nose slightly crooked, but she carries herself as if the flaws only enhance her appeal. Good for her. For some reason, I mark her as Effy immediately, which makes her friend Claire. Her brown hair is short, curling around her jawline as if hugging it for comfort \u2013 like that actress whose name I always forget. Claire sports a full mouth that quivers in time with her right hand.\n Harry catches my attention and whispers, \u201cSir, you want me to separate them?\u201d\n I smile. \u201cGood thinking, Sergeant. Get their stories independent of each other? Not this time. Let\u2019s see what they say together. Watch \u2018em closely. Remember, we know something they don\u2019t.\u201d\n The two women have noticed us eyeing them and Effy quirks a golden eyebrow, so I walk over and make introductions via badge. Harry and I take a seat, but the small table forces us into close quarters with our interviewees.\n \u201cEffy Lempicka \u2013 Miss Effy Lempicka,\u201d the blonde announces. Her smirk never falters, and I wonder if it\u2019s a mask. Her friend\u2019s right hand is still jittering.  \n \u201cClaartje Blaak,\u201d the brunette clarifies, \u201cbut I prefer Claire.\u201d   \nHarry reacts to their names. His foot kicks my ankle involuntarily, and I see Miss Lempicka flick her sharp brown eyes towards him. His poker face needs work, especially around her. She\u2019s no fool.  \n \u201cThe two of you are waiting for Sam Babin.\u201d I make it a statement, not a question.\n Miss Blaak\u2019s eyes widen, but Lempicka speaks up: \u201cYes, Lieutenant.\u201d She offers me a cigarette, and I decline while she lights up.  \n \u201cWhy?\u201d I ask.\n Lempicka looks at Blaak and allows her to speak. I get the feeling that allow is just the right word for their relationship.\n \u201cInspiration,\u201d Blaak says. \u201cI\u2019m a novelist \u2013 a detective novelist. I need characters who feel real. Best way to create those is to talk to real people with real stories. Sam Babin is a PI. He\u2019s got real stories like some people\u2019s got debt.\u201d  \n Harry chips in, \u201cInspiration? That\u2019s all?\u201d\n Miss Blaak meets his eyes with a cold smile. \u201cHe\u2019ll be here soon. Then, you can ask him yourself.\u201d  \n \u201cWhat about you, Miss Lempicka?\u201d I ask.\n \u201cPlease call me Effy, Lieutenant. My interests align with my friend\u2019s\u2019. Only, instead of writing novels, I write for The New Yorker.\u201d\n \u201cReporter?\u201d I ask.\n \u201cGossip columnist,\u201d Harry interjects. \u201cMuck-raker!\u201d\n Miss Lempicka keeps her eyes on me, reacting to the insult like a statue does to pigeons. \u201cYes, Lieutenant, and I often shadow my novelist friend. Real stories are my stock-in-trade too, and I can strike a vein anywhere.\u201d   \n I catch Harry\u2019s eye and nod.\n He asks the vital question. \u201cSo, Sam Babin is coming here to meet the two of you?\u201d\n \u201cNo,\u201d Effy replies. \u201cThere\u2019s another regular girl here \u2013 a real high jumper, but Sam likes her. Really likes her, if you know what I mean, but I can never remember her name, and I don\u2019t see her around just now. Guess she likes stories too. The whole city is full of addicts. Whatcha gonna do?\u201d She holds my eyes for a full minute. I don\u2019t look away, but I\u2019m itching to.\n \u201cCan you remember what this woman looks like?\u201d I ask, still holding her gaze.\n \u201cBeautiful,\u201d she answers. \u201cIn an\u2026 unusual way. Blonde hair, like mine, but short and curly, like Claire\u2019s.\u201d\n I notice Miss Blaak\u2019s eyes widen before she recomposes her features into a stolid smile.\n I rise and put my fedora back on my head. \u201cThank you for your cooperation. Please do not leave town. We may want to interview you again. Your compliance is appreciated.\u201d\n \u201cSpeaking for myself,\u201d Effy replies. \u201cI look forward to a second interview. The innocent have nothing to fear, right, Lieutenant?\u201d  \n Without another word, I head for the door.\n \u201cSir,\u201d Harry hisses while we walk. \u201cI know those two!\u201d  \n \u201cI know, Sergeant, and they know you know.\u201d  \n He blushes. \u201cSorry, sir. Thing is, sir, that novelist, her books are all set in this city, and she makes the police look dumber than a potato stuck in a drainpipe. Her friend is no better. She uses her pen like a whip, sir, and she spares neither high nor low. She\u2019s made some of the boys at the station look like fools. Ditto politicians and business tycoons.\u201d\n \u201cDoes that mean you know where she lives?\u201d\n \u201cNot yet\u2026 Sir, you didn\u2019t tell them Sam got popped.\u201d\n I don\u2019t answer. \u201cCoroner\u2019s report will only be available tomorrow. Until then, we have work to do. Find out where these women live, and let\u2019s think of someone who might offer insights into their comings and goings.\u201d    \n\n",

He\u2019s peering out the glass windows of the office belonging to Thomas Delaney \u2013 Editor-in-Chief of The New Yorker. From this vantage point, we look down on an anthill of frenetic activity in the room below. It resembles the police station: crammed with desks and bodies jostling about, smelling of sweat and cigarettes. \n \u201cMy uncle is a beekeeper,\u201d Harry comments. \u201cThe reporters down there make a beehive look like a holiday resort.\u201d  \n \u201cMy empire!\u201d a voice announces behind us, and Mr Delaney strides into his office. He takes a seat behind a huge desk that is, contrary to all my expectations, neatly ordered. \u201cNever a dull moment!\u201d Mr Delaney bellows, a cigar balancing precariously between his teeth. \u201cWhat can I do for the law, today?\u201d He leans forward, resting his narrow chin on his hands. Huge, round spectacles encircle glittering brown eyes. He makes me feel like I\u2019m being measured for a story.  \n I say, \u201cMiss Effy Lempicka works for you.\u201d\n Mr Delaney emits a plume of smoke, his eyes brimming with pride. \u201cYes! She sure does. Bright mind, sharp tongue, sharper vocabulary \u2013 and a nose for insalubrious chatter. She\u2019s a talent, an earner and thus a keeper. Why? What\u2019s your interest in her?\u201d\n I lean back in my chair and let Harry play out the strategy we\u2019d cooked up earlier. \u201cWe need her real name.\u201d \n\u201cWhat makes you think Lempicka isn\u2019t it?\u201d\nHarry replies, \u201cWe can\u2019t find her address. It\u2019s not unusual for gossip columnists to use a nom de plume.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s say I\u2019m in no mood to give you her real name?\u201d\n\u201cThen I\u2019d say you\u2019re on the wrong side of the law. We have a legal right to that information when murder is at play.\u201d\nDelaney shrugs, \u201cEfimiya Uvarova. You\u2019re talking about the death of that PI, right? Sam Babin? Care to make a comment for the press?\u201d \n\u201cNo.\u201d Harry presses on: \u201cMiss Efimiya Uvarova might have information we need, and she might be holding out. We need you to instruct her to speak candidly to us.\u201d   \n\u201cYou got a warrant for her arrest?\u201d Mr Delaney asks, eyes flicking between our faces like fingers on a typewriter \u2013 still searching for a story.\n Harry pushes on, \u201cNow mister, how do you think your rivals in the news business will respond when they hear about the police coming round here with a warrant? They\u2019ll pounce like wild cats. They\u2019ll rip their claws into your reputation.\u201d  \n Mr Delaney throws his eyes at the ceiling, and laughs like a sailor seeing land after months at sea. \u201cNo, Sergeant! You couldn\u2019t be more wrong if you thought you could sell me the Brooklyn Bridge. Look at my head. Any idea what kind of nasty brain hunkers in this skull? Now, look at those bodies jostling around down there on the floor? Between my brains and theirs, we\u2019ll conjure a story about the law suppressing freedom of speech and voila! David vs Goliath! The plucky reporters and their editor duking it out with the heavy hand of the law \u2013 which, as everyone knows, has some dirt under its nails. The scandal-hungry masses will eat it all up like a Boston cream pie.\u201d\n Harry bristles. Time for me to intervene. \u201cTell you what,\u201d I say. \u201cOnce the case is done and dusted, I will sit for an exclusive interview. How about that?\u201d\nMr Delaney smiles like a shark scenting blood. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\nI take time to formulate my question. \u201cImagine that Sam Babin was set to meet with Miss Uvarova and some of her friends. What would you say to that?\u201d  \n \u201cI\u2019d say: what\u2019s it to you?\u201d\nI lean back in my chair and nod to Harry, who asks, \u201cWould you suspect Mr Babin of having ill intentions towards your gossip columnist?\u201d \n Mr Delaney watches Harry long enough for the air to grow heavy. Then he flicks his eyes at me, and back to Harry. A few moments later, he glances at his watch and nods his head. I figure he\u2019s made his choice.\n \u201cFreddie Forsythe.

We have a legal right to that information when murder is at play.\u201d\nDelaney shrugs, \u201cEfimiya Uvarova. You\u2019re talking about the death of that PI, right? Sam Babin? Care to make a comment for the press?\u201d \n\u201cNo.\u201d Harry presses on: \u201cMiss Efimiya Uvarova might have information we need, and she might be holding out. We need you to instruct her to speak candidly to us.\u201d   \n\u201cYou got a warrant for her arrest?\u201d Mr Delaney asks, eyes flicking between our faces like fingers on a typewriter \u2013 still searching for a story.\n Harry pushes on, \u201cNow mister, how do you think your rivals in the news business will respond when they hear about the police coming round here with a warrant? They\u2019ll pounce like wild cats. They\u2019ll rip their claws into your reputation.\u201d  \n Mr Delaney throws his eyes at the ceiling, and laughs like a sailor seeing land after months at sea. \u201cNo, Sergeant! You couldn\u2019t be more wrong if you thought you could sell me the Brooklyn Bridge. Look at my head. Any idea what kind of nasty brain hunkers in this skull? Now, look at those bodies jostling around down there on the floor? Between my brains and theirs, we\u2019ll conjure a story about the law suppressing freedom of speech and voila! David vs Goliath! The plucky reporters and their editor duking it out with the heavy hand of the law \u2013 which, as everyone knows, has some dirt under its nails. The scandal-hungry masses will eat it all up like a Boston cream pie.\u201d\n Harry bristles. Time for me to intervene. \u201cTell you what,\u201d I say. \u201cOnce the case is done and dusted, I will sit for an exclusive interview. How about that?\u201d\nMr Delaney smiles like a shark scenting blood. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\nI take time to formulate my question. \u201cImagine that Sam Babin was set to meet with Miss Uvarova and some of her friends. What would you say to that?\u201d  \n \u201cI\u2019d say: what\u2019s it to you?\u201d\nI lean back in my chair and nod to Harry, who asks, \u201cWould you suspect Mr Babin of having ill intentions towards your gossip columnist?\u201d \n Mr Delaney watches Harry long enough for the air to grow heavy. Then he flicks his eyes at me, and back to Harry. A few moments later, he glances at his watch and nods his head. I figure he\u2019s made his choice.\n \u201cFreddie Forsythe.
